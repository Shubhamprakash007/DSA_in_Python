1 / 1

Greedy algorithm is a type of algorithm that makes the best possible decision at each step based on the current information, without considering the global optimal solution. It is a simple and intuitive approach that is often used for optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of choices. Greedy algorithms are efficient and easy to implement, but they may not always produce the optimal solution for all problems.

Here are some key characteristics of greedy algorithms:

1.  Greedy Choice Property: A greedy algorithm makes a locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that this will lead to a globally optimal solution. This means that the choice made at the current step is the best possible choice considering the information available at that moment, without considering the future consequences.
    
2.  Lack of Backtracking: Greedy algorithms do not typically revisit decisions made in the past. Once a choice is made, it is not reconsidered, which can sometimes result in suboptimal solutions.
    
3.  May not always guarantee optimal solution: Greedy algorithms do not always guarantee finding the optimal solution. Since they make decisions based only on the current information, they may miss the globally optimal solution in some cases.
    
4.  Efficient: Greedy algorithms are often efficient because they do not require exhaustive exploration of all possible solutions, which makes them suitable for large-scale problems where other approaches may be computationally expensive.
    
5.  Applications: Greedy algorithms are commonly used in various real-world applications such as scheduling, routing, graph problems, and resource allocation, among others.
    
6.  Examples: Some well-known examples of greedy algorithms include Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree in a graph, Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, and the Huffman coding algorithm for data compression.
    
7.  Trade-offs: Greedy algorithms often involve trade-offs between different factors, and the choice of the greedy strategy can impact the quality of the solution obtained. Careful consideration of the problem's characteristics and the specific requirements of the application is necessary to determine if a greedy algorithm is suitable for a given problem.
    

In summary, greedy algorithms are simple, efficient, and intuitive approaches for solving optimization problems, but they may not always guarantee finding the optimal solution. Careful analysis of the problem and the specific requirements of the application is necessary when considering the use of a greedy algorithm.

> concepts that i need to remember to solve leetcode problem of greedy algorithm

1 / 1

To solve LeetCode problems that involve greedy algorithms, it's important to keep in mind some key concepts:

1.  Greedy Choice Property: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to achieve a globally optimal solution. Understanding the optimal choice at each step based on the given problem's constraints and requirements is crucial.
    
2.  Problem Analysis: Analyzing the problem statement and understanding its constraints, input/output requirements, and problem-specific characteristics is essential. Identify what makes the problem amenable to a greedy approach and how to make the best choices at each step.
    
3.  Sorting: Sorting is often a useful technique in greedy algorithms, as it can help order elements or choices based on specific criteria. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order, depending on the problem's requirements.
    
4.  Iterative Approach: Greedy algorithms typically involve iterating through the problem space, making choices at each step. Understanding how to iteratively update the solution while adhering to the greedy choice property is important.
    
5.  Greedy vs. Backtracking: Greedy algorithms differ from backtracking, as greedy algorithms make irreversible choices at each step without revisiting them, while backtracking involves exploring multiple choices and potentially backtracking to previous states. Distinguishing between the two approaches and choosing the right one is crucial.
    
6.  Optimal Substructure: Some greedy problems may exhibit optimal substructure, where the optimal solution to the problem can be built from optimal solutions to smaller subproblems. Understanding and utilizing optimal substructure can be key to solving greedy problems.
    
7.  Proof of Correctness: Providing a formal proof of the correctness of the greedy algorithm can add confidence to the solution. Proving that the locally optimal choices made at each step lead to a globally optimal solution is important.
    
8.  Test Cases: Thoroughly testing the implementation with different test cases, including edge cases and corner cases, is crucial to verify the correctness and efficiency of the solution.
    
9.  Trade-offs: Greedy algorithms often involve trade-offs between different factors, such as time complexity, space complexity, and solution optimality. Understanding and managing these trade-offs is important in designing an effective greedy algorithm.
    
10.  Practice and Experience: Solving various LeetCode problems involving greedy algorithms and gaining experience in analyzing problems, making optimal choices, and implementing efficient solutions through practice can significantly improve your skills in solving such problems.
    

By keeping these concepts in mind and practicing regularly, you can develop a solid foundation for solving LeetCode problems that involve greedy algorithms effectively.

> 1 / 1
> 
> give answer of each of these one by one

1 / 1

Certainly! Here are brief answers to the top 20 greedy algorithm interview questions:

1.  A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step in the hope of finding a globally optimal solution. It selects the best available option at each step without reconsidering previous choices.
    
2.  An example of a problem that can be solved using a greedy algorithm is the "coin change" problem, where the goal is to make change for a given amount of money using the fewest number of coins of different denominations.
    
3.  The general approach for designing a greedy algorithm involves three steps: making a greedy choice at each step, proving that this choice is safe, and then updating the problem state and moving to the next step until the solution is found.
    
4.  The advantages of greedy algorithms include simplicity, efficiency, and ease of implementation. They can often provide fast solutions to optimization problems. However, greedy algorithms may not always guarantee the optimal solution and may require careful consideration of the problem constraints and characteristics.
    
5.  The optimal choice at each step in a greedy algorithm is chosen based on a specific criterion or heuristic, which depends on the problem being solved. This criterion can be based on factors such as maximum value, minimum cost, or maximum coverage, among others.
    
6.  The main difference between a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming approach is that a greedy algorithm makes a locally optimal choice at each step, while a dynamic programming approach solves subproblems and builds the solution from the bottom up, often considering multiple choices at each step.
    
7.  Determining if a problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm often requires careful analysis of the problem constraints and characteristics. Generally, problems that exhibit the "greedy choice property" and the "optimal substructure property" can be solved using a greedy approach.
    
8.  In the context of greedy algorithms, a "greedy choice" refers to the locally optimal choice made at each step based on a specific criterion or heuristic, without reconsidering previous choices.
    
9.  The time complexity of a typical greedy algorithm depends on the problem and the specific implementation, but it is generally efficient and can often provide fast solutions to optimization problems.
    
10.  An example of a problem where a greedy approach may not always lead to an optimal solution is the "fractional knapsack" problem, where the goal is to fill a knapsack with limited capacity with items of different weights and values to maximize the total value. In some cases, a greedy approach may not always yield the optimal solution.
    
11.  The "greedy stays ahead" principle is used in some greedy algorithms to show that the chosen greedy choice is safe and leads to an optimal solution. It involves comparing the greedy choice with the optimal solution at each step and showing that the greedy choice does not fall behind the optimal solution.
    
12.  The "exchange argument" is a technique used in some greedy algorithms to prove their correctness. It involves showing that for any optimal solution, it is always possible to exchange it with the greedy choice without deteriorating the solution's quality.
    
13.  Proving the correctness of a greedy algorithm often requires careful analysis and may involve techniques such as induction, exchange argument, or mathematical proof. It is important to provide a rigorous and logical argument to demonstrate that the chosen greedy choice is safe and leads to an optimal solution.
    
14.  Greedy algorithms have many real-world applications, such as in scheduling tasks, finding the shortest paths, optimizing resources allocation, and solving problems in fields like computer networks, finance, and telecommunications, among others.
    
15.  Handling cases where multiple greedy choices are possible in a problem often requires further analysis and consideration of additional criteria or constraints. This may involve selecting the greedy choice that maximizes or minimizes another parameter, or applying a tie-breaking rule to resolve the ambiguity.

1 / 1

16.  Some problems may have multiple greedy algorithms that can solve them, and the choice of which greedy algorithm to use may depend on factors such as problem size, input characteristics, and time constraints.
    
17.  Greedy algorithms can sometimes be combined with other algorithmic techniques, such as dynamic programming, binary search, or graph algorithms, to solve more complex problems. This may involve using a greedy algorithm as a building block or as a substep in a larger algorithm.
    
18.  Understanding the time complexity and space complexity of a greedy algorithm is important for analyzing its efficiency and performance. Greedy algorithms are typically efficient in terms of time complexity, but their space complexity may vary depending on the problem and the specific implementation.
    
19.  Greedy algorithms can be used to solve both discrete and continuous optimization problems. Discrete optimization problems involve finding the optimal solution from a finite set of choices, while continuous optimization problems involve finding the optimal solution from a continuous domain.
    
20.  Practicing solving problems and implementing greedy algorithms through coding exercises, coding competitions, and real-world applications can greatly improve your understanding and proficiency in using greedy algorithms for problem-solving and interview preparation.
    

Note: Please keep in mind that these are brief answers, and it's important to thoroughly understand the concepts and practice solving problems to fully grasp the intricacies of greedy algorithms.

> Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target class Solution: def maxNonOverlapping(self, nums: List\[int\], target: int) -> int: leetcode problem complete this code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's a possible implementation of the `maxNonOverlapping` function for the "Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target" problem on LeetCode, using a greedy approach:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNonOverlapping(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        seen = {0}  # to keep track of seen prefix sums
        prefix_sum = 0  # current prefix sum
        count = 0  # count of non-overlapping subarrays
        
        for num in nums:
            prefix_sum += num  # calculate prefix sum
            
            # check if prefix_sum - target is seen before
            # which means there is a subarray with sum equals to target
            if prefix_sum - target in seen:
                count += 1  # increment count of non-overlapping subarrays
                seen = {0}  # reset seen to only include current prefix_sum
                prefix_sum = 0  # reset prefix_sum to start a new subarray
            else:
                seen.add(prefix_sum)  # add current prefix_sum to seen
        
        return count
```

The idea of the solution is to use a hash set `seen` to keep track of the prefix sums seen so far. We iterate through the `nums` array and calculate the prefix sum at each index. If the difference between the current prefix sum and the target is found in the `seen` set, it means we have found a non-overlapping subarray with the sum equals to the target. In that case, we increment the `count` of non-overlapping subarrays, reset the `seen` set to only include the current prefix sum, and reset the `prefix_sum` to start a new subarray. Otherwise, we add the current prefix sum to the `seen` set. Finally, we return the `count` of non-overlapping subarrays as the result.

        # Iterate through all amounts from 1 to amount
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            # Iterate through all coins
            for coin in coins:
                # If the coin is less than or equal to the current amount i
                if coin <= i:
                    # Update the dp value for current amount i
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
        
        # If dp[amount] is still infinity, it means no valid combination of coins exists
        # to make change for the given amount, so return -1, otherwise return the dp[amount]
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

The idea of the solution is to use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for each amount from 0 to the given `amount`. We use an array `dp` to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount. We initialize `dp[0]` to 0 as the base case, and then iterate through all amounts from 1 to `amount`. For each amount, we iterate through all coins, and if a coin is less than or equal to the current amount, we update the `dp` value for the current amount by taking the minimum between its current value and the value at `dp[i - coin] + 1`, where `i` is the current amount and `coin` is the coin we are considering. Finally, we return the `dp[amount]` as the result, which represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given `amount`. If `dp[amount]` is still infinity, it means no valid combination of coins exists to make change for the given amount, so we return -1.

I apologize for the confusion. The "Coin Change" problem is actually not a greedy problem, but rather a classic dynamic programming problem. It cannot be optimally solved using a greedy approach, as there may not always exist a greedy choice that guarantees the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.

In the "Coin Change" problem, you are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. You need to find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given `amount`. Each coin in `coins` has an unlimited supply.

As mentioned earlier, the optimal solution for this problem requires dynamic programming. The greedy approach, where you always choose the coin with the largest denomination, may not always yield the correct result. For example, consider the case where `coins = [2, 5, 10]` and `amount = 18`. The greedy approach would suggest choosing 10, then 5, and finally 2, for a total of 3 coins. However, the optimal solution is to choose two coins of denomination 5 and four coins of denomination 2, for a total of 6 coins.

Therefore, to solve the "Coin Change" problem optimally, you would need to use a dynamic programming approach as shown in the previous solution.

1 / 1

Yes, "Jump Game" is a greedy problem. Here's a possible implementation of the `canJump` function for the "Jump Game" problem on LeetCode, which uses a greedy approach:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Initialize the maximum index that can be reached
        max_jump = 0
        
        # Iterate through the nums array
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # If the current index is greater than the maximum index that can be reached,
            # return False as it means we cannot reach the current index
            if i > max_jump:
                return False
            
            # Update the maximum index that can be reached
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i + nums[i])
        
        # If the loop completes without returning False, it means we can reach the last index
        return True
```

The idea of the solution is to iterate through the `nums` array from left to right, keeping track of the maximum index that can be reached (`max_jump`) at each index. If at any point the current index is greater than the `max_jump`, it means we cannot reach the current index and we can return `False`. Otherwise, we update the `max_jump` by taking the maximum between its current value and the sum of the current index `i` and the number of steps that can be jumped from the current index `nums[i]`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means we can reach the last index and we can return `True`.

> Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers leetcode problem give the code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's a possible implementation of the `mincostToHireWorkers` function for the "Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def mincostToHireWorkers(self, quality: List[int], wage: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Create a list of workers, where each worker is represented as a tuple of (quality, wage) and sorted by the ratio of wage to quality in ascending order
        workers = [(wage[i] / quality[i], quality[i], wage[i]) for i in range(len(quality))]
        workers.sort()
        
        heap = []  # Create a min heap to keep track of the top k workers by quality
        total_quality = 0  # Keep track of the total quality of the top k workers
        min_cost = float('inf')  # Initialize the minimum cost to a large positive value
        
        # Iterate through the sorted workers
        for ratio, q, w in workers:
            heapq.heappush(heap, -q)  # Push the negative quality to the min heap
            
            total_quality += q  # Add the quality of the current worker to the total quality
            
            # If the size of the min heap exceeds k, remove the worker with the highest quality
            if len(heap) > k:
                total_quality += heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            # If the size of the min heap is equal to k, calculate the cost of hiring the top k workers
            if len(heap) == k:
                min_cost = min(min_cost, ratio * total_quality)
        
        return min_cost
```

The solution uses a greedy approach to find the minimum cost to hire k workers. It first creates a list of workers sorted by the ratio of wage to quality in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted workers and uses a min heap to keep track of the top k workers by quality. The total quality of the top k workers is updated at each iteration, and the minimum cost is calculated as the product of the ratio of wage to quality of the current worker and the total quality of the top k workers. Finally, the function returns the minimum cost.

> 1 / 1
> 
> explain the above code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the above code:

1.  First, the function `mincostToHireWorkers` takes three input parameters: `quality`, `wage`, and `k`. `quality` is a list of integers representing the quality of each worker, `wage` is a list of integers representing the wage of each worker, and `k` is an integer representing the number of workers to hire.
    
2.  Next, the code creates a list of workers using a list comprehension. Each worker is represented as a tuple of `(ratio, quality, wage)`, where `ratio` is the ratio of wage to quality for that worker, calculated as `wage[i] / quality[i]`, and `quality` and `wage` are the respective values from the input lists. The list of workers is sorted by the `ratio` in ascending order using the `sort` method.
    
3.  Then, a min heap `heap` is created using the `heapq` module, which will be used to keep track of the top k workers by quality. The `total_quality` variable is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total quality of the top k workers, and the `min_cost` variable is initialized to a large positive value to store the minimum cost.
    
4.  The code iterates through the sorted workers using a for loop. For each worker, the negative value of its quality is pushed to the `heap` using the `heappush` method, which maintains the min heap property.
    
5.  The `total_quality` is updated by adding the quality of the current worker to it.
    
6.  If the size of the `heap` exceeds k, meaning there are more than k workers in the heap, the worker with the highest quality (i.e., the smallest negative value in the heap) is removed using the `heappop` method, and its quality is added to the `total_quality`. This ensures that only the top k workers by quality are kept in the heap.
    
7.  If the size of the `heap` is equal to k, meaning there are exactly k workers in the heap, the cost of hiring the top k workers is calculated as the product of the `ratio` of the current worker and the `total_quality`. The `min_cost` is updated by taking the minimum between its current value and the calculated cost.
    
8.  Finally, after the loop completes, the function returns the `min_cost`, which represents the minimum cost to hire k workers with the given constraints.

> Non-overlapping Intervals leetcode problem give me the code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the code to solve the "Non-overlapping Intervals" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort intervals by end time in ascending order
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        # Initialize variables
        count = 0 # Number of intervals to remove
        prev_end = float('-inf') # End time of previous interval
        
        # Iterate through intervals
        for interval in intervals:
            start, end = interval
            if start >= prev_end:
                # If current interval does not overlap with previous interval,
                # update prev_end to current interval's end time
                prev_end = end
            else:
                # If current interval overlaps with previous interval,
                # increment count by 1
                count += 1
        
        return count
```

The above code uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It sorts the intervals by their end times in ascending order, and then iterates through the intervals. For each interval, it compares the start time with the end time of the previous interval. If the start time of the current interval is greater than or equal to the end time of the previous interval, it means the two intervals do not overlap, and the end time of the current interval is updated as the new previous end time. Otherwise, if the start time of the current interval is less than the end time of the previous interval, it means the two intervals overlap, and one of them needs to be removed to make them non-overlapping. In this case, the count of removed intervals is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the count, which represents the minimum number of intervals to remove to make all intervals non-overlapping.

> explain the code

1 / 1

Sure! Let me explain the code step by step:

1.  The class `Solution` is defined, which is a typical structure for solving problems in LeetCode.
    
2.  The function `eraseOverlapIntervals` takes a list of intervals as input, where each interval is represented as a list of two integers `[start, end]`. The goal is to find the minimum number of intervals to remove in order to make all intervals non-overlapping.
    
3.  The `intervals` list is sorted by the end times of the intervals in ascending order using the `sort` method and a custom key function. The key function is defined using a lambda function that takes an interval `x` and returns its end time `x[1]`. This ensures that the intervals are sorted by their end times.
    
4.  Two variables are initialized: `count` to keep track of the number of intervals to remove, and `prev_end` to store the end time of the previous interval. `prev_end` is initially set to negative infinity to ensure that any valid interval with a non-negative end time will be greater than it.
    
5.  The function iterates through the sorted intervals using a `for` loop.
    
6.  For each interval, the start time `start` and end time `end` are extracted.
    
7.  The start time `start` of the current interval is compared with the end time `prev_end` of the previous interval.
    
8.  If the start time of the current interval is greater than or equal to the end time of the previous interval, it means the two intervals do not overlap. In this case, the end time `end` of the current interval is updated as the new previous end time `prev_end`.
    
9.  Otherwise, if the start time of the current interval is less than the end time of the previous interval, it means the two intervals overlap. In this case, one of them needs to be removed to make them non-overlapping. The count of removed intervals `count` is incremented by 1.
    
10.  After iterating through all intervals, the function returns the count, which represents the minimum number of intervals to remove in order to make all intervals non-overlapping.

Sure! Here's the code for solving the "Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons" problem on LeetCode:

ruby

```ruby
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort the intervals by their end times
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        # Initialize the number of arrows to 0
        arrows = 0
        
        # Initialize the end time of the previous balloon to negative infinity
        prev_end = float('-inf')
        
        # Iterate through the intervals
        for start, end in points:
            # If the start time of the current balloon is greater than the end time of the previous balloon,
            # it means a new arrow is needed to burst the current balloon
            if start > prev_end:

                prev_end = end
        
        # Return the total number of arrows needed
        return arrows
```

This code uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It sorts the intervals by their end times in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted intervals. For each interval, it compares the start time of the current balloon with the end time of the previous balloon. If the start time of the current balloon is greater than the end time of the previous balloon, it means a new arrow is needed to burst the current balloon. The end time of the current balloon is then updated as the new previous end time. After iterating through all the balloons, the function returns the total number of arrows needed, which represents the minimum number of arrows to burst all balloons.

python

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        # Count the frequency of each task
        task_counts = collections.Counter(tasks)
        
        # Get the tasks with the highest frequency
        max_freq = max(task_counts.values())
        num_max_freq_tasks = list(task_counts.values()).count(max_freq)
        
        # Calculate the total number of intervals required
        intervals = (max_freq - 1) * (n + 1) + num_max_freq_tasks
        
        # Return the maximum between the calculated intervals and the total number of tasks
        return max(intervals, len(tasks))
```

This code uses a greedy approach to schedule the tasks in a way that minimizes the number of intervals required. It counts the frequency of each task, identifies the tasks with the highest frequency, and calculates the total number of intervals needed based on the maximum frequency and the cooling period `n`. Finally, it returns the maximum between the calculated intervals and the total number of tasks as the result.

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Gas Station" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def can_complete_circuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        total_gas = 0
        current_gas = 0
        starting_station = 0
        
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
            current_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
            
            # If current gas is negative, update starting station and reset current gas
            if current_gas < 0:
                starting_station = i + 1
                current_gas = 0
        
        # If total gas is negative, return -1, else return starting station
        return starting_station if total_gas >= 0 else -1
```

This code uses a concise greedy approach to find the starting gas station where you can complete a circular route without running out of gas. It iterates through the gas stations, keeps track of the total gas and current gas (gas - cost), and updates the starting station and resets the current gas if the current gas is negative. Finally, it returns the starting station if the total gas is non-negative, otherwise -1.

> 1 / 1
> 
> explain the code

1 / 1

Sure! The code for the "Gas Station" problem uses a greedy approach to find the starting gas station where you can complete a circular route without running out of gas. Here's how it works:

1.  Initialize `total_gas` and `current_gas` to 0, and `starting_station` to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the total gas, current gas, and the starting gas station, respectively.
    
2.  Iterate through the gas stations using a for loop, from index 0 to len(gas)-1.
    
3.  For each gas station, calculate the difference between gas and cost, and add it to both `total_gas` and `current_gas`. This represents the net gas gain or loss at the current gas station.
    
4.  Check if `current_gas` is negative. If it is, it means you cannot start from the current gas station as you will run out of gas before completing the circular route. In that case, update `starting_station` to the next gas station (i.e., `i + 1`) and reset `current_gas` to 0, indicating that you start with a full tank of gas from the new starting station.
    
5.  After iterating through all the gas stations, check if `total_gas` is non-negative. If it is, it means you can complete the circular route without running out of gas, and you return the value of `starting_station` as the starting gas station. Otherwise, return -1 to indicate that it's not possible to complete the circular route.
    

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of gas stations, as we iterate through the gas stations once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the variables.

> Queue Reconstruction by Height leetcode problem give me the concise code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Queue Reconstruction by Height" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        people.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        result = []
        
        for p in people:
            result.insert(p[1], p)
        
        return result
```

This code uses a concise greedy approach to reconstruct the queue based on the given heights and in-front counts of people. It sorts the people list in descending order of height (taller people first) and ascending order of in-front count (lower in-front count first). Then, it iterates through the sorted people list and inserts each person at the index equal to their in-front count using the `insert()` method, which automatically shifts the existing elements to make room for the new person. Finally, it returns the reconstructed queue as the result.

> 1 / 1
> 
> explain the code

1 / 1

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the concise code for the "Queue Reconstruction by Height" problem:

1.  First, the `people` list is sorted in descending order of height (`x[0]`) using the `sort()` method with a custom sorting key defined as `lambda x: (-x[0], x[1])`. This ensures that taller people come first in the sorted list, and in case of a tie in height, people with lower in-front count (`x[1]`) come first.
    
2.  Next, an empty list `result` is initialized to store the reconstructed queue.
    
3.  The code iterates through the sorted `people` list using a for loop.
    
4.  For each person `p` in the `people` list, the `insert()` method is used to insert the person at the index equal to their in-front count `p[1]` in the `result` list. Since the `insert()` method shifts the existing elements to make room for the new element, it automatically reconstructs the queue based on the given heights and in-front counts.
    
5.  After iterating through all the people, the reconstructed queue is stored in the `result` list.
    
6.  Finally, the `result` list is returned as the output, which represents the queue reconstructed by height and in-front count.
    

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of people, because the `insert()` method can take up to O(n) time in the worst case due to shifting of elements. However, the average time complexity is usually much better due to efficient implementation of the `insert()` method in most programming languages. The space complexity is O(n), as we use a separate list to store the reconstructed queue.

> Lemonade Change leetcode problem give me the concise code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Lemonade Change" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def lemonadeChange(self, bills: List[int]) -> bool:
        five, ten = 0, 0
        
        for bill in bills:
            if bill == 5:
                five += 1
            elif bill == 10:
                if not five:
                    return False
                five -= 1
                ten += 1
            else:
                if ten and five:
                    ten -= 1
                    five -= 1
                elif five >= 3:
                    five -= 3
                else:
                    return False
        
        return True
```

This code uses a greedy approach to simulate the process of providing change to customers who are buying lemonade with different denominations of bills. It keeps track of the number of available 5-dollar bills (`five`) and 10-dollar bills (`ten`) while iterating through the bills list. If a customer pays with a 5-dollar bill, it simply increments the count of available 5-dollar bills. If a customer pays with a 10-dollar bill, it checks if there is at least one available 5-dollar bill to provide change, and if so, it decrements the count of 5-dollar bills and increments the count of 10-dollar bills. If a customer pays with a 20-dollar bill, it first tries to provide change using one 10-dollar bill and one 5-dollar bill (if available), otherwise it tries to provide change using three 5-dollar bills (if available), otherwise it returns False indicating that change cannot be provided. If the code successfully iterates through all the bills without returning False, it returns True indicating that change can be provided for all customers.

> Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II leetcode problem give me the concise code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        
        return profit
```

This code uses a greedy approach to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks. It iterates through the prices list, and whenever it finds a pair of prices where the price on the next day is higher than the price on the current day, it adds the difference to the profit. This way, it captures all the potential profits that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks multiple times, as there are no restrictions on the number of transactions allowed in this problem. Finally, it returns the accumulated profit as the result.

> 1 / 1
> 
> explain the code

1 / 1

Certainly! The code uses a simple greedy approach to solve the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II" problem on LeetCode.

1.  Initialize a variable `profit` to 0, which will keep track of the accumulated profit.
2.  Iterate through the `prices` list from index 1 to the end using a for loop.
3.  For each pair of consecutive prices, compare the price on the next day (`prices[i]`) with the price on the current day (`prices[i-1]`).
4.  If the price on the next day is higher than the price on the current day, it means we can make a profit by buying the stock on the current day and selling it on the next day. In that case, add the difference between the two prices (`prices[i] - prices[i-1]`) to the `profit` variable.
5.  Repeat this process for all pairs of consecutive prices in the list.
6.  Once the loop completes, the `profit` variable will store the accumulated profit from all the profitable transactions.
7.  Return the `profit` as the final result.

The key idea here is to capture all the potential profits by buying and selling stocks multiple times, as there are no restrictions on the number of transactions allowed in this problem. This is achieved by greedily buying and selling stocks whenever a profitable opportunity arises.

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Partition Labels" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        last_occurrence = {}
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            last_occurrence[char] = i
        
        result = []
        start = 0
        end = 0
        
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            end = max(end, last_occurrence[char])
            if i == end:
                result.append(end - start + 1)
                start = i + 1
        
        return result
```

This code uses a greedy approach to find the lengths of partitions in a string such that each letter appears in only one partition. It iterates through the string twice, first to create a dictionary `last_occurrence` that stores the last occurrence index of each letter, and then to find the partitions based on the last occurrence indices.

1.  Create an empty dictionary `last_occurrence` to store the last occurrence index of each letter in the string `s`.
2.  Iterate through `s` using a for loop with index `i` and character `char`.
3.  For each character, update its last occurrence index in the `last_occurrence` dictionary.
4.  Initialize `result`, `start`, and `end` to empty list, 0, and 0 respectively.
5.  Iterate through `s` again using a for loop with index `i` and character `char`.
6.  For each character, update the `end` variable with the maximum of its current value and its last occurrence index from the `last_occurrence` dictionary.
7.  Check if `i` is equal to `end`. If it is, it means we have reached the end of the current partition, so we append the length of the partition to the `result` list (which is `end - start + 1`) and update the `start` variable to the next index (i + 1).
8.  Repeat this process for all characters in `s`.
9.  Once the loop completes, the `result` list will contain the lengths of all the partitions.
10.  Return the `result` list as the final result.

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Jump Game II" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return 0
        
        jumps = 0
        curr_max = 0
        next_max = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > curr_max:
                curr_max = next_max
                jumps += 1
            
            next_max = max(next_max, i + nums[i])
        
        return jumps
```

This code uses a greedy approach to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index of the input list `nums` where each element in the list represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped from that position.

1.  Check if the length of `nums` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, return 0 as no jumps are needed.
2.  Initialize `jumps` to 0, `curr_max` to 0, and `next_max` to 0.
3.  Iterate through `nums` using a for loop with index `i`.
4.  Inside the loop, check if `i` is greater than `curr_max`. If it is, update `curr_max` to `next_max` (which represents the maximum index that can be reached with the current number of jumps) and increment `jumps` by 1 as we need to make another jump to reach the next index.
5.  Update `next_max` with the maximum value between its current value and `i + nums[i]`, which represents the next maximum index that can be reached from the current position.
6.  Repeat this process for all elements in `nums`.
7.  Once the loop completes, the `jumps` variable will contain the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index of `nums`.
8.  Return `jumps` as the final result.

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Assign Cookies" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        count = 0
        
        while i < len(g) and j < len(s):
            if s[j] >= g[i]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                j += 1
        
        return count
```

This code uses a greedy approach to find the maximum number of content children that can be satisfied, given the greed factor of each child and the size of each cookie. The goal is to maximize the count of satisfied children.

1.  Sort both the `g` (greed factor) and `s` (cookie size) lists in ascending order.
2.  Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 0, and a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the count of satisfied children.
3.  While both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists, compare the greed factor of the child at index `i` with the size of the cookie at index `j`.
4.  If the size of the cookie is greater than or equal to the greed factor of the child, increment the `count`, `i`, and `j` by 1 to indicate that the child has been satisfied and move on to the next child and cookie.
5.  If the size of the cookie is less than the greed factor of the child, increment only `j` by 1 to try the next cookie with the same child.
6.  Repeat steps 3-5 until one of the pointers goes out of bounds.
7.  Once the loop completes, the `count` variable will contain the maximum number of content children that can be satisfied.
8.  Return `count` as the final result.

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Bag of Tokens" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def bagOfTokensScore(self, tokens: List[int], P: int) -> int:
        tokens.sort()
        left = 0
        right = len(tokens) - 1
        score = 0
        max_score = 0
        
        while left <= right:
            if tokens[left] <= P:
                P -= tokens[left]
                score += 1
                left += 1
                max_score = max(max_score, score)
            elif score > 0:
                P += tokens[right]
                score -= 1
                right -= 1
            else:
                break
        
        return max_score
```

This code uses a greedy approach to maximize the score in the game of tokens, given the initial power `P` and the values of tokens in the `tokens` list.

1.  Sort the `tokens` list in ascending order to have the minimum value tokens at the beginning and the maximum value tokens at the end.
2.  Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the beginning and end of the sorted `tokens` list, respectively.
3.  Initialize a `score` variable to 0 to keep track of the current score.
4.  Initialize a `max_score` variable to 0 to keep track of the maximum score achieved.
5.  While `left` pointer is less than or equal to `right` pointer, do the following:
    *   If the value of token at `left` pointer is less than or equal to the current power `P`, increment the `score` by 1, deduct the token value from `P`, and move the `left` pointer to the right by 1.
    *   Update the `max_score` with the current `score` if it is greater than the current `max_score`.
    *   If the value of token at `left` pointer is greater than `P` and `score` is greater than 0, increment the `P` with the value of token at `right` pointer, deduct the `score` by 1, and move the `right` pointer to the left by 1.
    *   If none of the above conditions are met, break out of the loop.
6.  Return the `max_score` as the final result.

Sure! Here's a concise code for the "Wiggle Subsequence" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return len(nums)
        
        prev_diff = nums[1] - nums[0]
        count = 1 if prev_diff != 0 else 0
        
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            curr_diff = nums[i] - nums[i-1]
            if (curr_diff > 0 and prev_diff <= 0) or (curr_diff < 0 and prev_diff >= 0):
                count += 1
                prev_diff = curr_diff
        
        return count + 1
```

This code uses a greedy approach to find the length of the longest wiggle subsequence in the given list of numbers `nums`.

1.  If the length of `nums` is less than 2, return the length of `nums` as the result, as there can be at most 1 element in the wiggle subsequence.
2.  Initialize a `prev_diff` variable to store the difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[0]` as the initial previous difference.
3.  Initialize a `count` variable to 1 if `prev_diff` is not equal to 0, else 0, as the first two elements in `nums` always form a valid wiggle subsequence.
4.  Iterate through `nums` starting from the third element:
    *   Calculate the difference `curr_diff` between the current element and the previous element.
    *   If `curr_diff` has a different sign than `prev_diff`, increment `count` by 1, as the current element can be part of the wiggle subsequence.
    *   Update `prev_diff` with `curr_diff`.
5.  Return `count + 1` as the final result, as we need to count the first element as well.

Sure! Here's the code for the "Candy" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n
        
        # Pass from left to right, ensure higher rated child gets more candies than lower rated child
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1
        
        # Pass from right to left, ensure lower rated child gets more candies than higher rated child if needed
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1)
        
        return sum(candies)
```

This code uses a greedy approach to distribute candies to children with different ratings, such that the following two conditions are met:

1.  Higher rated child gets more candies than a lower rated child.
2.  If a child has a higher rating than both its left and right neighbors, it gets more candies than both of them.

The code first initializes an array `candies` with all elements set to 1, as each child initially gets at least one candy. Then, it iterates through `ratings` from left to right, and updates `candies` based on the relative ratings of neighboring children. Next, it iterates through `ratings` from right to left, and further updates `candies` to ensure that the above two conditions are met for all children. Finally, the sum of elements in `candies` is returned as the minimum total number of candies needed to satisfy the conditions.

> 1 / 1
> 
> explain the code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's an explanation of the "Candy" problem solution code:

1.  The function `candy` takes in a list of integers `ratings`, which represents the ratings of children.
2.  The variable `n` is initialized to the length of `ratings`, which represents the number of children.
3.  The list `candies` is initialized with all elements set to 1, as each child initially gets at least one candy.
4.  The first loop iterates through `ratings` from left to right, starting from the second child (index 1), and updates `candies` based on the relative ratings of neighboring children. If the rating of the current child is greater than the rating of its left neighbor, the number of candies given to the current child is set to the number of candies given to its left neighbor plus one. This ensures that a higher rated child gets more candies than a lower rated child.
5.  The second loop iterates through `ratings` from right to left, starting from the second-to-last child (index `n-2`), and further updates `candies` to ensure that the above condition is met for all children. If the rating of the current child is greater than the rating of its right neighbor, the number of candies given to the current child is set to the maximum value between the number of candies given to its current value and the number of candies given to its right neighbor plus one. This ensures that if a child has a higher rating than both its left and right neighbors, it gets more candies than both of them.
6.  Finally, the sum of elements in `candies` is returned as the minimum total number of candies needed to satisfy the conditions, as each element in `candies` represents the number of candies given to each child.

Sure! Here's the Python code for the "Car Pooling" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        # Create a list to store the number of passengers at each stop
        stops = [0] * 1001
        
        # Update the number of passengers at each stop based on the trips
        for trip in trips:
            # Add passengers at the start of the trip
            stops[trip[1]] += trip[0]
            # Subtract passengers at the end of the trip
            stops[trip[2]] -= trip[0]
        
        # Keep track of the current number of passengers
        passengers = 0
        
        # Iterate through the stops and check if the capacity is exceeded at any stop
        for stop in stops:
            # Update the current number of passengers
            passengers += stop
            # If the capacity is exceeded, return False
            if passengers > capacity:
                return False
        
        # If the capacity is never exceeded, return True
        return True
```

Explanation:

1.  The function `carPooling` takes in a list of trips, where each trip is a list of three integers representing the number of passengers, the start location, and the end location respectively, and an integer `capacity` representing the maximum number of passengers the car can carry.
2.  A list `stops` of size 1001 is created to represent the number of passengers at each stop. The index of the list represents the stop location, and the value at that index represents the net change in the number of passengers at that stop (i.e., the number of passengers added minus the number of passengers dropped).
3.  The number of passengers at each stop is updated based on the trips. For each trip, the number of passengers is added at the start location and subtracted at the end location in the `stops` list.
4.  A variable `passengers` is used to keep track of the current number of passengers in the car.
5.  The stops are iterated through, and at each stop, the current number of passengers is updated by adding the net change in passengers from the `stops` list.
6.  If the current number of passengers exceeds the capacity at any stop, `False` is returned, indicating that the car cannot complete the trips with the given capacity. Otherwise, `True` is returned, indicating that the car can complete the trips within the given capacity.

> Remove Covered Intervals leetcode problem give me the concise code

Sure! Here's the Python code for the "Remove Covered Intervals" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def removeCoveredIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort the intervals by start time in ascending order, and end time in descending order
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        
        # Initialize the count of uncovered intervals to the total number of intervals
        uncovered = len(intervals)
        # Initialize the maximum end time to track covered intervals
        max_end = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted intervals
        for interval in intervals:
            # If the current interval's end time is less than or equal to the maximum end time,
            # it is covered by a previous interval, so decrement the count of uncovered intervals
            if interval[1] <= max_end:
                uncovered -= 1
            # If the current interval's end time is greater than the maximum end time,
            # update the maximum end time to the current interval's end time
            else:
                max_end = interval[1]
        
        # Return the count of uncovered intervals
        return uncovered
```

Explanation:

1.  The function `removeCoveredIntervals` takes in a list of intervals, where each interval is a list of two integers representing the start time and end time respectively.
2.  The intervals are sorted by start time in ascending order, and end time in descending order using the `sort` function and a custom sorting key. Sorting by end time in descending order ensures that intervals with the same start time are sorted in such a way that the shorter intervals come first.
3.  A variable `uncovered` is initialized to the total number of intervals, as all intervals are initially considered uncovered.
4.  A variable `max_end` is used to keep track of the maximum end time encountered so far, initially set to 0.
5.  The sorted intervals are iterated through. For each interval, if its end time is less than or equal to the current maximum end time, it means the interval is covered by a previous interval, so the count of uncovered intervals is decremented.
6.  If the current interval's end time is greater than the current maximum end time, it means the interval is not covered by any previous interval, so the maximum end time is updated to the current interval's end time.
7.  After iterating through all intervals, the count of uncovered intervals is returned as the final result.

Explanation:

1.  The function `numRescueBoats` takes in a list of people's weights and a weight limit for each boat.
2.  The people are sorted in ascending order of their weights using the `sort` function.
3.  Two pointers `left` and `right` are initialized to the lightest and heaviest person respectively.
4.  A variable `boats` is initialized to 0 to count the number of boats needed.
5.  The while loop continues until the two pointers meet or cross. In each iteration:
    *   If the sum of weights of the lightest and heaviest person is less than or equal to the weight limit, it means they can be placed on the same boat. So, the `left` pointer is incremented and the `right` pointer is decremented.
    *   If the sum of weights is greater than the weight limit, it means only the heaviest person can be placed on a boat. So, the `right` pointer is decremented.
    *   In both cases, the count of boats is incremented for each iteration.
6.  After the loop, the count of boats is returned as the final result.

Sure! Here's the Python code for the "Jump Game III" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def canReach(self, arr: List[int], start: int) -> bool:
        # Create a set to keep track of visited indices
        visited = set()
        
        # Define a recursive helper function to perform DFS
        def dfs(idx):
            # Base case: If the current index is out of bounds, return False
            if idx < 0 or idx >= len(arr):
                return False
            
            # Base case: If the current value is 0, return True
            if arr[idx] == 0:
                return True
            
            # If the current index has already been visited, return False
            if idx in visited:
                return False
            
            # Mark the current index as visited
            visited.add(idx)
            
            # Recursive cases:
            # Perform DFS to the left and right of the current index
            return dfs(idx - arr[idx]) or dfs(idx + arr[idx])
        
        # Call the DFS helper function with the starting index
        return dfs(start)
```

Explanation:

1.  The function `canReach` takes in a list of integers `arr` representing the array of non-negative integers, and an integer `start` representing the starting index.
2.  A set `visited` is created to keep track of the indices that have already been visited.
3.  The function defines a recursive helper function `dfs` to perform Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from a given index `idx`.
4.  In the DFS helper function:
    *   Base case 1: If the current index is out of bounds, i.e., less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, return False as we have reached an invalid index.
    *   Base case 2: If the value at the current index is 0, return True as we have reached a position where we can jump to the target value of 0.
    *   If the current index has already been visited, return False as we have encountered a cycle in the array and cannot reach the target value of 0.
    *   Mark the current index as visited by adding it to the `visited` set.
    *   Perform DFS to the left and right of the current index by recursively calling the `dfs` function with `idx - arr[idx]` and `idx + arr[idx]` respectively.
    *   If either of the recursive calls returns True, return True as we have found a path to the target value of 0.
5.  Finally, call the `dfs` helper function with the starting index `start` and return the result as the final output.

Sure! Here's the Python code for the "Minimum Platforms" problem on GeeksforGeeks:

python

```python
class Solution:
    # Function to find the minimum number of platforms required
    # at the railway station such that no train waits.
    def minimumPlatform(self, n: int, arr: List[int], dep: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort the arrival and departure arrays in ascending order
        arr.sort()
        dep.sort()
        
        # Initialize variables to keep track of platforms and maximum platforms
        platforms = 1
        max_platforms = 1
        i = 1
        j = 0
        
        # Perform a merge-like comparison of arrival and departure times
        # to find overlapping time intervals
        while i < n and j < n:
            # If the arrival time of the current train is less than or equal
            # to the departure time of the previous train, it means there is an
            # overlapping time interval and a new platform is required
            if arr[i] <= dep[j]:
                platforms += 1
                i += 1
            # If the arrival time of the current train is greater than the
            # departure time of the previous train, it means the previous train
            # has departed and a platform is freed up
            else:
                platforms -= 1
                j += 1
            
            # Update the maximum platforms required
            max_platforms = max(max_platforms, platforms)
        
        return max_platforms
```

Explanation:

1.  The function `minimumPlatform` takes in an integer `n` representing the number of trains, and two lists of integers `arr` and `dep` representing the arrival and departure times of the trains respectively.
2.  The function first sorts the `arr` and `dep` arrays in ascending order.
3.  It then initializes variables `platforms` and `max_platforms` to keep track of the number of platforms and the maximum number of platforms required respectively. It also initializes pointers `i` and `j` to 1 and 0 respectively, as we start comparing arrival and departure times from the second train and the first train.
4.  The function then performs a merge-like comparison of arrival and departure times to find overlapping time intervals. It uses a while loop that continues until `i` and `j` reach the end of the arrays.
5.  Inside the while loop, it compares the arrival time of the current train with the departure time of the previous train:
    *   If the arrival time of the current train is less than or equal to the departure time of the previous train, it means there is an overlapping time interval and a new platform is required. In this case, `platforms` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.
    *   If the arrival time of the current train is greater than the departure time of the previous train, it means the previous train has departed and a platform is freed up. In this case, `platforms` is decremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1.
6.  After each comparison, the function updates the maximum number of platforms required by taking the maximum of the current `max_platforms` and `platforms`.
7.  Finally, the function returns the `max_platforms` as the minimum number of platforms required at the railway station such that no train waits.

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the Python code for the "Job Sequencing Problem" on GeeksforGeeks:

python

```python
class Solution:
    
    # Function to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.
    def JobScheduling(self, Jobs, n):
        # Sort the jobs by their profits in descending order
        Jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
        
        # Create a list to keep track of the slots for each day
        slots = [False] * (n+1)
        
        total_profit = 0
        total_jobs = 0

                    break
        
        return [total_jobs, total_profit]
```

Explanation:

1.  The function `JobScheduling` takes in a list of jobs `Jobs` and an integer `n` representing the number of jobs.
2.  The function first sorts the jobs by their profits in descending order using the `sort` function and a custom lambda function as the key. This ensures that jobs with higher profits come first in the sorted list.
3.  It then creates a list `slots` of size `n+1` to keep track of the slots for each day. The slots are initialized as `False`, indicating that they are empty initially.
4.  It also initializes variables `total_profit` and `total_jobs` to keep track of the total profit and total number of jobs done.
5.  The function iterates through the sorted jobs and fills the slots from right to left. For each job, it iterates through the slots from the job's deadline to 1, and checks if the slot is empty. If it finds an empty slot, it marks it as occupied (`True`), adds the job's profit to the total profit, increments the total number of jobs done, and breaks out of the inner loop.
6.  After filling the slots for all the jobs, the function returns a list `[total_jobs, total_profit]` containing the total number of jobs done and the total profit earned.

> Jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x\[2\], reverse=True) TypeError: 'Job' object does not support indexing

1 / 1

I apologize for the confusion. The code I provided assumes that the `Jobs` input is a list of tuples with three elements representing the jobs, where each tuple contains three values: (job\_id, deadline, profit). However, it seems that the input `Jobs` in your case is not a list of tuples, but rather a custom object `Job` that does not support indexing.

To modify the code for the custom `Job` object, you would need to update the `key` function in the `sort` method accordingly, based on the attributes of the `Job` object. For example, if the `Job` object has `deadline` and `profit` as its attributes, you could update the code as follows:

python

```python
class Solution:
    
    # Function to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.
    def JobScheduling(self, Jobs, n):
        # Sort the jobs by their profits in descending order
        Jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x.profit, reverse=True)
        
        # Create a list to keep track of the slots for each day
        slots = [False] * (n+1)
        
        total_profit = 0
        total_jobs = 0
        
        # Iterate through the jobs and fill the slots from right to left
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(min(n, Jobs[i].deadline), 0, -1):
                if not slots[j]:
                    slots[j] = True
                    total_profit += Jobs[i].profit
                    total_jobs += 1
                    break
        
        return [total_jobs, total_profit]
```

Note: Please update the attribute names (`profit` and `deadline`) according to the actual attribute names in your `Job` object.

Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the modified code:

python

```python
class Solution:
    
    # Function to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.
    def JobScheduling(self, Jobs, n):
        # Sort the jobs by their profits in descending order
        Jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x.profit, reverse=True)
        
        # Create a list to keep track of the slots for each day
        slots = [False] * (n+1)
        
        total_profit = 0
        total_jobs = 0
        
        # Iterate through the jobs and fill the slots from right to left
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(min(n, Jobs[i].deadline), 0, -1):
                if not slots[j]:
                    slots[j] = True
                    total_profit += Jobs[i].profit
                    total_jobs += 1
                    break
        
        return [total_jobs, total_profit]
```

1.  Sort the `Jobs` list by their profits in descending order using the `sort` method with a custom key function. The `lambda x: x.profit` function specifies that we want to sort the `Jobs` list based on the `profit` attribute of each `Job` object, and `reverse=True` ensures that the sorting is done in descending order, i.e., highest profits first.
    
2.  Create a list `slots` of length `n+1` to keep track of the availability of slots for each day. Initialize all slots as `False` initially.
    
3.  Initialize `total_profit` and `total_jobs` as 0, which will be used to keep track of the total profit and total number of jobs scheduled.
    
4.  Iterate through the `Jobs` list using a for loop, where `i` represents the index of each job.
    
5.  For each job, iterate through the slots from right to left using a nested for loop, where `j` represents the slot/day number.
    
6.  Check if the slot `j` is available (i.e., `slots[j]` is `False`), and if so, mark it as scheduled by setting `slots[j]` to `True`. Add the profit of the current job to `total_profit` and increment `total_jobs` by 1.
    
7.  Break out of the inner loop once a slot is scheduled for the current job, as each job can only be scheduled once.
    
8.  After iterating through all the slots for the current job, move on to the next job in the `Jobs` list.
    
9.  Finally, return a list `[total_jobs, total_profit]` containing the total number of jobs scheduled and the total profit earned.

Sure! Here's the code to solve the "N meetings in one room" problem from GeeksforGeeks:

python

```python
class Solution:
    
    # Function to find the maximum number of meetings that can be performed in a meeting room.
    def maximumMeetings(self, n, start, end):
        # Create a list of tuples to store the start and end times of meetings
        meetings = [(start[i], end[i]) for i in range(n)]
        
        # Sort the meetings based on their end times in ascending order
        meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum number of meetings and the current end time
        max_meetings = 0
        current_end = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted meetings
        for meeting in meetings:
            # If the start time of the current meeting is greater than the current end time,
            # it means this meeting can be scheduled, so increment the max_meetings count and
            # update the current end time to be the end time of this meeting
            if meeting[0] > current_end:
                max_meetings += 1
                current_end = meeting[1]
        
        return max_meetings
```

This code uses a greedy approach to find the maximum number of meetings that can be performed in a meeting room. It first creates a list of tuples to store the start and end times of meetings. Then, it sorts the list of meetings based on their end times in ascending order. It then iterates through the sorted list of meetings and checks if the start time of the current meeting is greater than the current end time. If it is, it means this meeting can be scheduled as it does not overlap with any previously scheduled meeting. So, it increments the max\_meetings count and updates the current end time to be the end time of this meeting. Finally, it returns the max\_meetings count, which represents the maximum number of meetings that can be performed in the meeting room without any overlapping.

1 / 1

Certainly! Let me explain the code for the "N meetings in one room" problem from GeeksforGeeks.

The problem statement states that there are N meetings with their start and end times given as arrays `start` and `end`, respectively. The task is to find the maximum number of meetings that can be scheduled in a meeting room without any overlapping.

The code uses a greedy approach to solve this problem. Here's how the code works step by step:

1.  It creates a list of tuples to store the start and end times of meetings using a list comprehension. The `meetings` list will contain tuples of the form `(start[i], end[i])`, where `start[i]` represents the start time of the i-th meeting and `end[i]` represents the end time of the i-th meeting.
    
2.  It then sorts the `meetings` list based on their end times in ascending order using the `sort()` method with a custom key function. The key function is defined as `lambda x: x[1]`, which returns the second element (i.e., end time) of each tuple. Sorting the meetings based on end times is crucial for the greedy approach, as it allows us to prioritize meetings with earlier end times.
    
3.  It initializes two variables: `max_meetings` to keep track of the maximum number of meetings that can be scheduled without any overlapping, and `current_end` to keep track of the current end time of scheduled meetings, initially set to 0.
    
4.  It then iterates through the sorted list of meetings using a for loop. For each meeting, it checks if the start time of the current meeting (i.e., `meeting[0]`) is greater than the current end time (i.e., `current_end`). If it is, it means this meeting can be scheduled as it does not overlap with any previously scheduled meeting. So, it increments the `max_meetings` count by 1 and updates the `current_end` to be the end time of this meeting (i.e., `meeting[1]`).
    
5.  Finally, it returns the `max_meetings` count, which represents the maximum number of meetings that can be scheduled in the meeting room without any overlapping.
    

This greedy approach works because it prioritizes scheduling meetings with earlier end times, which allows us to fit more meetings in the meeting room without overlapping.

        # Sort the meetings based on their end times in ascending order

        # Initialize variables to keep track of maximum number of meetings and current end time

                current_end = meeting[1]

        # Return the maximum number of meetings
        return max_meetings
```

This code uses a greedy approach to find the maximum number of meetings that can be performed in a meeting room without any overlapping. It creates a list of tuples to store the start and end times of meetings, sorts them based on their end times in ascending order, and then iterates through the sorted list to count the number of non-overlapping meetings. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the number of meetings.

Certainly! Let's go through the code for the "N meetings in one room" problem step by step:

1.  `class Solution:`: This is the definition of a class named `Solution` which will contain the solution to the problem.
    
2.  `def maximumMeetings(self, n, start, end):`: This is the function definition for the `maximumMeetings` method, which takes three parameters as input:
    
    *   `n`: An integer representing the number of meetings
    *   `start`: A list of integers representing the start times of the meetings
    *   `end`: A list of integers representing the end times of the meetings
3.  `meetings = [(start[i], end[i]) for i in range(n)]`: This line creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end times of a meeting. The `start` and `end` lists are iterated using a `for` loop and the corresponding start and end times are extracted and combined into tuples using a list comprehension.
    
4.  `meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])`: This line sorts the list of meetings based on their end times in ascending order. The `lambda` function is used as a key function to specify that the sorting should be done based on the second element of each tuple, which represents the end time of the meeting.
    
5.  `max_meetings = 0`: This variable is initialized to keep track of the maximum number of meetings that can be performed without overlapping.
    
6.  `current_end = 0`: This variable is initialized to keep track of the current end time of meetings.
    
7.  `for meeting in meetings:`: This `for` loop iterates through the sorted list of meetings.
    
8.  `if meeting[0] > current_end:`: This line checks if the start time of the current meeting is greater than the current end time, which means that the current meeting does not overlap with the previous meetings.
    
9.  `max_meetings += 1`: If the current meeting does not overlap with the previous meetings, then the maximum meetings count is incremented by 1.
    
10.  `current_end = meeting[1]`: The current end time is updated with the end time of the current meeting.
    
11.  Finally, the maximum number of meetings `max_meetings` is returned as the result.
    

This code uses a greedy approach to find the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings in a meeting room by sorting the meetings based on their end times and checking for overlaps with the previous meetings. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the number of meetings.

Sure! Let's go through the code for the "Fractional Knapsack" problem step by step:

1.  `class Item:`: This is the definition of a class named `Item` which represents the items to be considered for the knapsack problem. It has two attributes:
    
    *   `value`: An integer representing the value of the item
    *   `weight`: An integer representing the weight of the item
2.  `class Solution:`: This is the definition of a class named `Solution` which will contain the solution to the problem.
    
3.  `def fractionalknapsack(self, W, arr, n):`: This is the function definition for the `fractionalknapsack` method, which takes three parameters as input:
    
    *   `W`: An integer representing the capacity of the knapsack
    *   `arr`: A list of `Item` objects representing the items available for selection
    *   `n`: An integer representing the number of items
4.  `arr.sort(key=lambda x: x.value/x.weight, reverse=True)`: This line sorts the list of `Item` objects based on their value-to-weight ratio in descending order. The `lambda` function is used as a key function to specify that the sorting should be done based on the value-to-weight ratio, which is calculated as `value/weight` for each item.
    
5.  `max_value = 0`: This variable is initialized to keep track of the maximum total value that can be obtained from the knapsack.
    
6.  `for item in arr:`: This `for` loop iterates through the sorted list of `Item` objects.
    
7.  `if W >= item.weight:`: This line checks if the remaining capacity of the knapsack is greater than or equal to the weight of the current item, which means that the entire item can be selected.
    
8.  `max_value += item.value`: If the entire item can be selected, then its value is added to the maximum value.
    
9.  `W -= item.weight`: The weight of the selected item is subtracted from the remaining capacity of the knapsack.
    
10.  `else:`: If the remaining capacity of the knapsack is less than the weight of the current item, it means that the item cannot be selected completely.
    
11.  `max_value += (W/item.weight) * item.value`: In this case, the value of the item is multiplied by the fraction of its weight that can be accommodated in the remaining capacity of the knapsack, and the result is added to the maximum value.
    
12.  Finally, the maximum total value `max_value` is returned as the result.
    

This code uses a greedy approach to solve the fractional knapsack problem by selecting items based on their value-to-weight ratio in descending order. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the number of items.

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the complete code for the "Fractional Knapsack" problem:

python

```python
class Item:
    def __init__(self, val, w):
        self.value = val
        self.weight = w
        
class Solution:    
    #Function to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
    def fractionalknapsack(self, W, arr, n):
        arr.sort(key=lambda x: x.value/x.weight, reverse=True)
        max_value = 0
        for item in arr:
            if W >= item.weight:
                max_value += item.value
                W -= item.weight
            else:
                max_value += (W/item.weight) * item.value
                break
        return max_value
```

You can use this code to find the maximum total value that can be obtained from the knapsack, given the capacity of the knapsack and a list of items with their values and weights. The `Item` class represents the items, and the `Solution` class contains the `fractionalknapsack` method which implements the greedy approach to solve the problem.

> 1 / 1
> 
> explain the code

1 / 1

Sure! Let's go through the code for the "Fractional Knapsack" problem step by step:

1.  The `Item` class is defined to represent the items in the knapsack. It has two attributes: `value` and `weight`, which represent the value and weight of the item, respectively.
    
2.  The `Solution` class is defined, which contains the `fractionalknapsack` method to solve the problem.
    
3.  In the `fractionalknapsack` method, the input parameters are `W` (capacity of the knapsack), `arr` (a list of `Item` objects representing the items), and `n` (the number of items).
    
4.  First, the `arr` list is sorted in descending order based on the value-to-weight ratio of the items. This is done using a lambda function as the key for sorting, which calculates the value-to-weight ratio for each item and sorts the items in descending order.
    
5.  Next, a variable `max_value` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum total value that can be obtained from the knapsack.
    
6.  The items in the sorted `arr` list are iterated over using a `for` loop. For each item, the `weight` of the item is checked against the remaining capacity of the knapsack `W`.
    
7.  If the `weight` of the current item is less than or equal to the remaining capacity of the knapsack, then the entire item can be included in the knapsack. So, the `value` of the item is added to the `max_value`, and the `weight` of the item is subtracted from the remaining capacity of the knapsack `W`.
    
8.  If the `weight` of the current item is greater than the remaining capacity of the knapsack, then only a fraction of the item can be included in the knapsack to fully utilize the remaining capacity. So, the `value` of the item is multiplied by the ratio of remaining capacity of the knapsack to the `weight` of the item, and this value is added to the `max_value`. Then, the loop is terminated using the `break` statement.
    
9.  Finally, the `max_value` is returned, which represents the maximum total value that can be obtained from the knapsack with the given capacity.
    

The code uses a greedy approach by sorting the items based on the value-to-weight ratio and selecting the items with higher ratios first to maximize the total value in the knapsack.

> Target Sum this is a leetcode problem give its correct code

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the correct code to solve the "Target Sum" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        if abs(target) > total_sum or (total_sum + target) % 2 != 0:
            return 0
        # The target sum is valid only if the total sum and target sum have
        # the same parity. Otherwise, it's impossible to achieve the target sum.
        target_sum = (total_sum + target) // 2
        dp = [0] * (target_sum + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for num in nums:
            for i in range(target_sum, num - 1, -1):
                dp[i] += dp[i - num]
        return dp[target_sum]
```

Explanation:

1.  The `findTargetSumWays` function takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target` as input.
    
2.  First, we calculate the total sum of the numbers in the `nums` list.
    
3.  We check if the absolute value of the target is greater than the total sum. If it is, or if the sum of the total sum and target is not an even number, then it's impossible to achieve the target sum using the numbers in the `nums` list, so we return 0.
    
4.  Next, we calculate the target sum that we need to achieve. It's the average of the total sum and the target, rounded down to the nearest integer. We use this target sum in our dynamic programming approach.
    
5.  We create a `dp` list of size `target_sum + 1` and initialize it with all 0s. The `dp` list will store the number of ways to achieve each possible sum from 0 to the target sum.
    
6.  We set `dp[0]` to 1, because there is only one way to achieve a sum of 0, which is by not choosing any number from the `nums` list.
    
7.  We iterate over the `nums` list and for each number `num`, we update the `dp` list from `target_sum` to `num` (inclusive) in reverse order, because we need to update the `dp` list in a way that doesn't affect the values of `dp` that we need to calculate later.
    
8.  For each sum `i` in the `dp` list, we update `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i - num]`, because if we can achieve a sum of `i - num` using the numbers from the `nums` list, we can achieve a sum of `i` by adding `num` to it.
    
9.  Finally, we return the value of `dp[target_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to achieve the target sum using the numbers from the `nums` list.

Sure! Here's the code to solve the "Snakes and Ladders" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def snakesAndLadders(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(board)
        moves = [0] * (n * n + 1)

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

                    idx += 1
        
        queue = deque([(1, 0)]) # (position, steps)
        visited = set()
        visited.add(1)
        
        while queue:
            pos, steps = queue.popleft()
            if pos == n * n:
                return steps
            
            for i in range(1, 7):
                next_pos = pos + i
                if next_pos <= n * n and moves[next_pos] != -1:
                    next_pos = moves[next_pos]
                
                if next_pos not in visited:
                    queue.append((next_pos, steps + 1))
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        
        return -1
```

Explanation:

1.  The `snakesAndLadders` function takes a 2D list of integers `board` as input.
    
2.  First, we flatten the `board` into a 1D list `moves` of size `n * n + 1`, where `n` is the size of the board. The `moves` list represents the positions we can move to from each position on the board. We use a variable `idx` to keep track of the current position in the `moves` list.
    
3.  We use a nested loop to iterate over the `board` in reverse order, and fill the `moves` list with the values from the `board`. We use the `idx` variable to determine the position in the `moves` list to update.
    
4.  We use a queue to perform a BFS (breadth-first search) traversal of the board, starting from position 1 (top-left corner). Each element in the queue represents a position and the number of steps taken to reach that position.
    
5.  We use a set `visited` to keep track of the positions that have been visited, to avoid cycles and infinite loops.
    
6.  While the queue is not empty, we dequeue the front element, representing the current position and the number of steps taken to reach that position.
    
7.  If the current position is equal to `n * n`, which represents the bottom-right corner of the board, we have reached the end of the game and we return the number of steps taken.
    
8.  Otherwise, we generate all possible next positions by rolling a dice (from 1 to 6) and adding it to the current position. If the next position is within the bounds of the board, we update it with the value from the `moves` list if it's not equal to -1 (indicating a snake or ladder), and enqueue it into the queue if it hasn't been visited before.
    
9.  If we exhaust all possible moves from the current position and haven't reached the end of the game, we continue with the next element in the queue.
    
10.  If we finish the BFS traversal without reaching the end of the game, it means it's not possible to reach the end of the game, so we return -1.
    

> 2 / 2
> 
> explain the approach behind the above code

1 / 1

Sure! The approach used in the code is based on a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of the game board to find the shortest path from the start to the end position. Here's an overview of the approach:

1.  The input `board` is a 2D list of integers representing a snakes-and-ladders game board. The goal is to reach the bottom-right corner of the board, which represents the end position.
    
2.  First, the `board` is flattened into a 1D list `moves` of size `n * n + 1`, where `n` is the size of the board. The `moves` list represents the positions we can move to from each position on the board. The value at `moves[i]` indicates the position we can reach from position `i` by rolling a dice (from 1 to 6), or -1 if there is a snake or ladder at that position.
    
3.  A queue is used to perform a BFS traversal of the board, starting from position 1 (top-left corner). Each element in the queue represents a position and the number of steps taken to reach that position.
    
4.  A set `visited` is used to keep track of the positions that have been visited, to avoid cycles and infinite loops.
    
5.  While the queue is not empty, we dequeue the front element, representing the current position and the number of steps taken to reach that position.
    
6.  If the current position is equal to `n * n`, which represents the bottom-right corner of the board, we have reached the end of the game and we return the number of steps taken.
    
7.  Otherwise, we generate all possible next positions by rolling a dice (from 1 to 6) and adding it to the current position. If the next position is within the bounds of the board, we update it with the value from the `moves` list if it's not equal to -1 (indicating a snake or ladder), and enqueue it into the queue if it hasn't been visited before.
    
8.  If we exhaust all possible moves from the current position and haven't reached the end of the game, we continue with the next element in the queue.
    
9.  If we finish the BFS traversal without reaching the end of the game, it means it's not possible to reach the end of the game, so we return -1.
    

This approach ensures that we find the shortest path to the end position in terms of the number of steps taken, as we are using BFS which explores all possible moves from the current position before moving on to the next level of positions.

> Course Schedule II this is a leetcode problem give me the code

Sure! Here's the Python code to solve the "Course Schedule II" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Create adjacency list to represent the courses and their prerequisites
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        in_degrees = [0] * numCourses
        
        # Build the adjacency list and in-degrees count
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            adj_list[prereq].append(course)
            in_degrees[course] += 1
        
        # Initialize a queue for BFS
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if in_degrees[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        
        # Perform BFS
        result = []
        while queue:
            course = queue.popleft()
            result.append(course)
            for next_course in adj_list[course]:
                in_degrees[next_course] -= 1
                if in_degrees[next_course] == 0:
                    queue.append(next_course)
        
        # Check if all courses are taken
        if len(result) != numCourses:
            return []
        
        return result
```

The code uses a BFS approach to find a valid order to take all the courses, given the prerequisites. It first creates an adjacency list to represent the courses and their prerequisites, and also counts the in-degrees of each course (i.e., the number of prerequisites it has).

Then, it initializes a queue with courses that have no prerequisites, and performs a BFS traversal. For each course in the queue, it adds it to the result list, decrements the in-degrees of its dependent courses, and enqueues any course whose in-degrees become zero after decrementing.

After the BFS traversal, it checks if all courses are taken by comparing the length of the result list with the total number of courses. If not, it returns an empty list, indicating that it's not possible to take all courses with the given prerequisites. Otherwise, it returns the valid order of courses to take.

> Cheapest Flights Within K Stops leetcode problem give me correct code

Sure! Here's the Python code to solve the "Cheapest Flights Within K Stops" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, K: int) -> int:
        # Create adjacency list to represent flights
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in flights:
            adj_list[u].append((v, w))
        
        # Initialize heap for Dijkstra's algorithm
        heap = [(0, src, 0)]
        
        # Keep track of minimum cost to reach each node within K stops
        min_costs = {}
        
        # Perform Dijkstra's algorithm
        while heap:
            cost, node, stops = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            if node == dst:
                return cost
            
            if stops > K:
                continue
            
            if node not in min_costs or cost < min_costs[node]:
                min_costs[node] = cost
                
                for next_node, next_cost in adj_list[node]:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (cost + next_cost, next_node, stops + 1))
        
        return -1
```

The code uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the cheapest flight from the source (src) to the destination (dst) within K stops. It first creates an adjacency list to represent the flights using a dictionary with nodes as keys and a list of tuples as values. Each tuple contains the destination node and the corresponding flight cost.

Then, it initializes a heap with the source node and its cost as 0, and starts the Dijkstra's algorithm. It keeps track of the minimum cost to reach each node within K stops using a dictionary (min\_costs). It uses a priority queue (heap) to store nodes to be visited, where the priority is determined by the total cost to reach the node.

During the Dijkstra's algorithm, it pops the node with the minimum cost from the heap, and checks if it reaches the destination (dst). If so, it returns the cost as the result. Otherwise, it continues to visit the neighboring nodes, calculates the total cost to reach the neighboring nodes from the current node, and pushes them into the heap. It also keeps track of the number of stops from the source to the current node, and continues the algorithm until the number of stops exceeds K or the heap is empty.

Finally, if the destination is not reached within K stops, it returns -1 indicating that there is no valid flight path within the given constraints. Otherwise, it returns the cheapest cost to reach the destination.

1 / 1

I apologize for the confusion. Upon further review, I realized that there was a mistake in the code I provided earlier. In the code, I am using a dictionary to keep track of the minimum costs to reach each node within K stops. However, this approach may not be correct, as it does not consider the possibility of reaching the same node with a lower cost through a different path within K stops.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to keep track of the minimum costs using a 2D array, where the rows represent the nodes and the columns represent the number of stops. Here's the corrected code:

python

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, K: int) -> int:
        # Create adjacency list to represent flights
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in flights:
            adj_list[u].append((v, w))
        
        # Initialize heap for Dijkstra's algorithm
        heap = [(0, src, 0)]
        
        # Keep track of minimum cost to reach each node within K stops
        min_costs = [[float('inf')] * (K + 2) for _ in range(n)]
        min_costs[src][0] = 0
        
        # Perform Dijkstra's algorithm
        while heap:
            cost, node, stops = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            if node == dst:
                return cost
            
            if stops > K:
                continue
            
            if cost > min_costs[node][stops]:
                continue
                
            for next_node, next_cost in adj_list[node]:
                new_cost = cost + next_cost
                if new_cost < min_costs[next_node][stops + 1]:
                    min_costs[next_node][stops + 1] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_cost, next_node, stops + 1))
        
        return -1
```

In this modified version, we use a 2D array `min_costs` to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each node within K stops. We initialize it with a large value (infinity) for all entries except the source node with 0 cost. During the Dijkstra's algorithm, we update the `min_costs` array with the minimum cost to reach each node within K stops, and use it to decide whether to add a node to the heap or not. This ensures that we consider all possible paths within K stops and avoid missing any potential cheaper paths.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

> Network Delay Time

1 / 1

Here's a corrected code for the "Network Delay Time" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Create adjacency list to represent the network
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            adj_list[u].append((v, w))
        
        # Initialize heap for Dijkstra's algorithm
        heap = [(0, k)]
        
        # Keep track of minimum time to reach each node
        min_time = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        min_time[k] = 0
        
        # Perform Dijkstra's algorithm
        while heap:
            time, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            if time > min_time[node]:
                continue
                
            for next_node, next_time in adj_list[node]:
                new_time = time + next_time
                if new_time < min_time[next_node]:
                    min_time[next_node] = new_time
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_time, next_node))
        
        # Check if all nodes are reachable and return the maximum time
        max_time = max(min_time[1:])
        return max_time if max_time != float('inf') else -1
```

In this corrected code, we use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest time to reach all nodes from the given source node `k`. We maintain a heap to store nodes to be visited, and a `min_time` array to keep track of the minimum time to reach each node. We update the `min_time` array during the algorithm, and finally return the maximum time in the `min_time` array if all nodes are reachable, otherwise return -1.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

> 1 / 1
> 
> explain the code

1 / 1

Sure! Let's go through the code for the "Network Delay Time" problem on LeetCode step by step:

1.  We start by importing necessary modules:

python

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict
```

The `heapq` module is used to implement the heap for Dijkstra's algorithm, and the `defaultdict` module is used to create an adjacency list to represent the network.

2.  Next, we define the `Solution` class that will contain our solution code:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
```

The `networkDelayTime` function takes in three parameters: `times` (a list of lists representing the network with `[u, v, w]` indicating an edge from node `u` to node `v` with time `w`), `n` (the number of nodes in the network), and `k` (the source node from which we need to calculate the network delay time).

3.  We create an adjacency list `adj_list` to represent the network, where the keys are the nodes `u` and the values are lists of tuples `(v, w)` representing edges from node `u` to node `v` with time `w`:

python

        ```python
adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            adj_list[u].append((v, w))
```

4.  We initialize a heap `heap` with the source node `k` and time 0, since we start from the source node with 0 time:

python

        ```python
heap = [(0, k)]
```

5.  We create a `min_time` array to keep track of the minimum time to reach each node, and initialize it with `float('inf')` for all nodes except the source node, which is initialized with 0:

python

        ```python
min_time = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        min_time[k] = 0
```

6.  We perform Dijkstra's algorithm using the heap to keep track of nodes to be visited:

python

        ```python
while heap:
            time, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
```

We pop the node with the minimum time from the heap.

7.  We check if the popped node has already been visited with a smaller time, and if so, we skip it:

python

            ```python
if time > min_time[node]:
                continue
```

8.  We iterate through the neighbors of the popped node, and update the `min_time` array if a shorter time is found:

python

            ```python
for next_node, next_time in adj_list[node]:
                new_time = time + next_time
                if new_time < min_time[next_node]:
                    min_time[next_node] = new_time
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_time, next_node))
```

We push the updated time and the next node to the heap for further exploration.

9.  Finally, we check if all nodes are reachable by checking if any node has a time of `float('inf')` in the `min_time` array. If so, we return -1, indicating that the network is not fully connected. Otherwise, we return the maximum time in the `min_time` array as the network delay time:

python

        ```python
max_time = max(min_time[1:])
        return max_time if max_time != float('inf') else -1
```

I hope this helps clarify the code for you! Let me know if you have any further questions.

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the code for the "Path With Minimum Effort" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minimumEffortPath(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows = len(heights)
        cols = len(heights[0])
        
        # Define the directions for moving to adjacent cells
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        # Create a heap to store cells with their effort and coordinates (row, col)
        heap = [(0, 0, 0)]
        
        # Create a set to keep track of visited cells
        visited = set()
        
        # Initialize the minimum effort array with infinity for all cells
        min_effort = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        
        # Start with the top-left cell and effort 0
        min_effort[0][0] = 0
        
        while heap:
            effort, row, col = heapq.heappop(heap)
            visited.add((row, col))
            
            # If we have reached the bottom-right cell, return the effort
            if row == rows - 1 and col == cols - 1:
                return effort
            
            # Explore all adjacent cells
            for dx, dy in directions:
                newRow, newCol = row + dx, col + dy
                if 0 <= newRow < rows and 0 <= newCol < cols and (newRow, newCol) not in visited:
                    newEffort = max(effort, abs(heights[row][col] - heights[newRow][newCol]))
                    if newEffort < min_effort[newRow][newCol]:
                        min_effort[newRow][newCol] = newEffort
                        heapq.heappush(heap, (newEffort, newRow, newCol))
        
        # If we cannot reach the bottom-right cell, return -1
        return -1
```

The code uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum effort path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in the given grid of heights. It maintains a heap to store cells with their current effort, and iteratively explores adjacent cells to update the minimum effort required to reach each cell. The code keeps track of visited cells and uses a 2D array `min_effort` to store the minimum effort required to reach each cell from the top-left cell. Finally, it returns the minimum effort required to reach the bottom-right cell, or -1 if it is not possible to reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell.

> explain the code

1 / 1

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code for the "Path With Minimum Effort" problem on LeetCode:

1.  We start by importing the necessary modules, `heapq` for the heap data structure, and defining the `Solution` class.
    
2.  Inside the `Solution` class, we define the `minimumEffortPath` function which takes a 2D grid of heights as input.
    
3.  We get the number of rows and columns in the grid using `len(heights)` and `len(heights[0])`, respectively.
    
4.  We define the directions for moving to adjacent cells as `directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]`, where `(0, 1)` represents moving right, `(1, 0)` represents moving down, `(0, -1)` represents moving left, and `(-1, 0)` represents moving up.
    
5.  We create a heap to store cells with their effort and coordinates (row, col) using `heap = [(0, 0, 0)]`, where the tuple `(0, 0, 0)` represents the top-left cell with effort 0.
    
6.  We create a set `visited` to keep track of visited cells.
    
7.  We initialize the `min_effort` 2D array with infinity for all cells using `min_effort = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]`, where `float('inf')` represents an initial effort value that is considered as infinity.
    
8.  We start the Dijkstra's algorithm by popping the cell with the minimum effort from the heap using `effort, row, col = heapq.heappop(heap)`.
    
9.  We add the popped cell to the visited set using `visited.add((row, col))`.
    
10.  We check if the popped cell is the bottom-right cell (i.e., `row == rows - 1` and `col == cols - 1`). If it is, we return the effort value as the minimum effort required to reach the bottom-right cell.
    
11.  If the popped cell is not the bottom-right cell, we explore all adjacent cells by iterating through the `directions` list.
    
12.  For each adjacent cell, we calculate the new effort required to reach that cell as the maximum of the current effort and the absolute difference between the height of the current cell and the height of the adjacent cell, using `newEffort = max(effort, abs(heights[row][col] - heights[newRow][newCol]))`.
    
13.  We then check if the new effort is less than the current effort stored in `min_effort` array for the adjacent cell, using `newEffort < min_effort[newRow][newCol]`. If it is, we update the `min_effort` array with the new effort value for the adjacent cell, and push the adjacent cell to the heap with the new effort value and its coordinates, using `heapq.heappush(heap, (newEffort, newRow, newCol))`.
    
14.  We continue this process until the heap is empty, meaning all cells have been visited or until we reach the bottom-right cell.
    
15.  If we cannot reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell, we return -1 as the minimum effort required to reach the bottom-right cell.

Certainly! Here's the code for the "Min Cost to Connect All Points" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(points)
        parent = list(range(n))
        rank = [0] * n

        def find(x):
            if parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])
            return parent[x]

        def union(x, y):
            root_x = find(x)
            root_y = find(y)
            if root_x != root_y:
                if rank[root_x] > rank[root_y]:
                    parent[root_y] = root_x
                else:
                    parent[root_x] = root_y
                    if rank[root_x] == rank[root_y]:
                        rank[root_y] += 1

        def distance(p1, p2):
            return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])

        edges = []
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                edges.append((distance(points[i], points[j]), i, j))

        edges.sort()
        result = 0
        num_edges = 0
        for d, u, v in edges:
            if find(u) != find(v):
                union(u, v)
                result += d
                num_edges += 1
            if num_edges == n - 1:
                break

        return result
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `minCostConnectPoints` function, which takes a list of points as input.
    
2.  We initialize the parent array with indices from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of points. This array will be used to keep track of the parent of each point in a disjoint set data structure.
    
3.  We also initialize the rank array with all zeros. This array will be used to keep track of the rank (or depth) of each disjoint set, which helps us optimize the union operation.
    
4.  We define two helper functions, `find` and `union`, which implement the find and union operations of the disjoint set data structure, respectively. The `find` function uses path compression to find the root (or parent) of a given element, and the `union` function uses union by rank to merge two disjoint sets.
    
5.  We define another helper function, `distance`, which calculates the Manhattan distance between two points, given their coordinates.
    
6.  We initialize an empty list, `edges`, to store the edges of the complete graph formed by the points. We iterate through all pairs of points and calculate the Manhattan distance between them, and add the distance along with the indices of the points as a tuple to the `edges` list.
    
7.  We sort the `edges` list in ascending order based on the distance.
    
8.  We initialize `result` to 0, which will store the total cost of connecting all points, and `num_edges` to 0, which will keep track of the number of edges included in the spanning tree.
    
9.  We iterate through the sorted `edges` list, and for each edge, we check if the two endpoints belong to different disjoint sets (i.e., their roots are not the same). If they do, we merge the two disjoint sets using the `union` function, add the distance of the edge to the `result`, and increment `num_edges` by 1.
    
10.  We continue this process until we have included n-1 edges in the spanning tree, where n is the number of points. At this point, all points will be connected

> Profitable Schemes

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the code for the "Profitable Schemes" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def profitableSchemes(self, n: int, minProfit: int, group: List[int], profit: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * (minProfit + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1

        for i in range(len(group)):
            g, p = group[i], profit[i]
            for j in range(n, g - 1, -1):
                for k in range(minProfit, -1, -1):
                    dp[j][min(minProfit, k + p)] += dp[j - g][k]
                    dp[j][min(minProfit, k + p)] %= MOD

        total_profit = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            total_profit += dp[i][minProfit]
            total_profit %= MOD

        return total_profit
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `profitableSchemes` function, which takes four inputs - `n` (total number of members), `minProfit` (minimum desired profit), `group` (list of group sizes), and `profit` (list of profits).
    
2.  We initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (minProfit+1)` to store the dynamic programming results. The value `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a profit of `j` using `i` members.
    
3.  We set the initial value of `dp[0][0]` to 1, as there is only one way to achieve a profit of 0 using 0 members (i.e., not choosing any scheme).
    
4.  We iterate through the `group` and `profit` lists using a for loop, and for each scheme, we update the `dp` array based on the group size `g` and profit `p` of the scheme.
    
5.  For each scheme, we iterate through the `dp` array in reverse order from `n` to `g - 1` (inclusive), as we need to ensure that we have enough members to form the group. For each member count `j`, we also iterate through the profit range from `minProfit` to 0 (inclusive), as we need to update the number of ways to achieve different profits.
    
6.  For each combination of `j` and `k`, we update `dp[j][min(minProfit, k + p)]` by adding `dp[j - g][k]` to it, which represents the number of ways to achieve a profit of `k` using `j - g` members, and taking modulo `MOD` to prevent integer overflow.
    
7.  After iterating through all the schemes, we calculate the total number of ways to achieve the minimum desired profit `minProfit` using different member counts from 0 to `n`, and store it in the variable `total_profit`.
    
8.  Finally, we return the `total_profit` modulo `MOD` as the result.

> Partition Equal Subset Sum

Sure! Here's the code for the "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        
        # If total sum is odd, return False
        if total_sum % 2 != 0:
            return False
        
        target_sum = total_sum // 2
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Initialize a 2D boolean dp array
        dp = [[False] * (target_sum + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # Base case: when target sum is 0, it is always possible to achieve
        for i in range(n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = True
        
        # DP loop
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, target_sum + 1):
                if nums[i - 1] <= j:
                    # If current number can be included in the sum
                    # either by including it or excluding it
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]
                else:
                    # If current number is greater than the target sum
                    # only option is to exclude it
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        
        # The result is at dp[n][target_sum]
        return dp[n][target_sum]
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `canPartition` function, which takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
    
2.  We calculate the total sum of all the numbers in the list `nums` and store it in the variable `total_sum`.
    
3.  If the total sum is odd, it is not possible to divide the numbers into two subsets with equal sum, so we return `False`.
    
4.  Otherwise, we calculate the target sum as half of the total sum, as we are trying to find two subsets with equal sum.
    
5.  We initialize a 2D boolean dp array of size `(n+1) x (target_sum+1)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` list, to store the dynamic programming results. The value `dp[i][j]` represents whether it is possible to achieve a sum of `j` using the first `i` numbers in the `nums` list.
    
6.  We set the base case in the `dp` array, where it is always possible to achieve a sum of 0 with any number of elements from the `nums` list. So, `dp[i][0]` is set to `True` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.
    
7.  We use a nested loop to iterate through the `dp` array from the second row (`i=1`) to the last row (`i=n`) and from the second column (`j=1`) to the last column (`j=target_sum`).
    
8.  For each combination of `i` and `j`, we check if the current number `nums[i - 1]` (since array indexing starts from 0) is less than or equal to the current target sum `j`.
    
9.  If the current number can be included in the sum, we update `dp[i][j]` by taking the logical OR of `dp[i - 1][j]` (representing excluding the current number) and `dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]` (representing including the current number), as either option can lead to achieving the target

```python

    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(coins)
        # Initialize a 2D dp array
        dp = [[0] * (amount + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # Base case: there is one way to make change for 0, which is not choosing any coin
        for i in range(n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = 1
        
        # DP loop
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, amount + 1):
                if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                    # If current coin can be included in the amount
                    # either by including it or excluding it
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - coins[i - 1]]
                else:
                    # If current coin is greater than the amount
                    # only option is to exclude it
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        
        # The result is at dp[n][amount]
        return dp[n][amount]
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `change` function, which takes an integer `amount` and a list of integers `coins` as input.
    
2.  We calculate the length of the `coins` list and store it in the variable `n`.
    
3.  We initialize a 2D dp array of size `(n+1) x (amount+1)`, where `n` is the length of the `coins` list, to store the dynamic programming results. The value `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to make change for the amount `j` using the first `i` coins from the `coins` list.
    
4.  We set the base case in the `dp` array, where there is one way to make change for 0, which is not choosing any coin. So, `dp[i][0]` is set to 1 for all `i` from 0 to `n`.
    
5.  We use a nested loop to iterate through the `dp` array from the second row (`i=1`) to the last row (`i=n`) and from the second column (`j=1`) to the last column (`j=amount`).
    
6.  For each combination of `i` and `j`, we check if the current coin `coins[i - 1]` (since array indexing starts from 0) is less than or equal to the current amount `j`.
    
7.  If the current coin can be included in the amount, we update `dp[i][j]` by taking the sum of `dp[i - 1][j]` (representing excluding the current coin) and `dp[i][j - coins[i - 1]]` (representing including the current coin), as either option can lead to making change for the current amount.
    
8.  If the current coin is greater than the current amount, we cannot include it in the change, so we update `dp[i][j]` by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][j]`, which represents not including the current coin.
    
9.  The result is at `dp[n][amount]`, which represents the number of ways to make change for the given amount using all the coins in the `coins` list.

Sure! Here's the code for the "Coin Change" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        # Initialize dp array with a large value
        dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
        # Base case: there is one way to make change for 0, which is not choosing any coin
        dp[0] = 0
        
        # DP loop
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
                # Update dp[i] if there is a smaller way to make change for i
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
        
        # If dp[amount] is still float('inf'), it means no valid way to make change
        # Otherwise, return the minimum number of coins needed to make change for amount
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `coinChange` function, which takes a list of integers `coins` and an integer `amount` as input.
    
2.  We initialize a dp array of size `(amount + 1)` with a large value (in this case, `float('inf')`) to store the dynamic programming results. The value `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the amount `i`.
    
3.  We set the base case in the `dp` array, where there is one way to make change for 0, which is not choosing any coin. So, `dp[0]` is set to 0.
    
4.  We use a nested loop to iterate through the `coins` list and the `dp` array. For each coin `coin` in `coins`, we start iterating from `coin` to `amount` in the `dp` array.
    
5.  For each combination of `coin` and `i`, we update `dp[i]` by taking the minimum value between the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - coin] + 1`. The value `dp[i - coin]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the remaining amount after deducting `coin` from `i`, and we add 1 to it to account for using the current coin.
    
6.  After the DP loop, `dp[amount]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given amount. If `dp[amount]` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid way to make change, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the value of `dp[amount]`.

> Course Schedule

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the code for the "Course Schedule" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Create adjacency list to represent the courses and their prerequisites
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        incoming_edges = [0] * numCourses
        
        # Populate the adjacency list and incoming edges count
        for course, prerequisite in prerequisites:
            graph[prerequisite].append(course)
            incoming_edges[course] += 1
        
        # Create a queue to perform topological sort
        queue = deque()
        
        # Add courses with no incoming edges to the queue
        for course in range(numCourses):
            if incoming_edges[course] == 0:
                queue.append(course)
        
        # Perform topological sort
        while queue:
            curr_course = queue.popleft()
            for course in graph[curr_course]:
                incoming_edges[course] -= 1
                if incoming_edges[course] == 0:
                    queue.append(course)
        
        # If there are no remaining courses with incoming edges, it means all courses can be completed
        return sum(incoming_edges) == 0
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `canFinish` function, which takes an integer `numCourses` and a list of pairs `prerequisites` as input. Each pair in `prerequisites` represents a course and its prerequisite.
    
2.  We create an adjacency list `graph` to represent the courses and their prerequisites. We also create an array `incoming_edges` of size `numCourses` to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each course.
    
3.  We populate the `graph` and `incoming_edges` by iterating through the `prerequisites` list. For each pair `(course, prerequisite)` in `prerequisites`, we add the course as a neighbor to the prerequisite in the `graph`, and increment the incoming edges count for the course in the `incoming_edges` array.
    
4.  We create a queue `queue` to perform topological sort. We add all courses with no incoming edges (i.e., courses with `incoming_edges[course] == 0`) to the `queue`.
    
5.  We perform topological sort by repeatedly dequeuing a course from the `queue`, decrementing the incoming edges count for its neighbors, and enqueuing the neighbors with no incoming edges to the `queue`. We continue this process until the `queue` is empty.
    
6.  After the topological sort, if there are no remaining courses with incoming edges (i.e., `sum(incoming_edges) == 0`), it means all courses can be completed without any circular dependencies, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

> Container With Most Water

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the code for the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the area between the two pointers
            h = min(height[left], height[right])
            w = right - left
            area = h * w
            
            # Update the maximum area
            max_area = max(max_area, area)
            
            # Move the pointers inward
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return max_area
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `maxArea` function, which takes a list of integers `height` as input, representing the heights of the bars in an array.
    
2.  We initialize `max_area` to 0, and two pointers `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
    
3.  We enter a while loop that continues until `left` and `right` meet. Inside the loop, we calculate the area between the two pointers by taking the minimum height of the two bars (`h`) and multiplying it by the width between the two pointers (`w`).
    
4.  We update `max_area` with the maximum of its current value and the calculated area.
    
5.  We then move the pointers inward. If the height of the bar at `left` is smaller than the height of the bar at `right`, we increment `left`, otherwise, we decrement `right`.
    
6.  After the loop, we return the maximum area. The idea is that we start with the widest possible container between the first and last bars, and gradually move the pointers inward while keeping track of the maximum area. This way, we explore all possible container configurations and find the one with the maximum area.

> Largest Number

1 / 1

Sure! Here's the code for the "Largest Number" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
from functools import cmp_to_key

class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        # Custom comparison function to sort numbers
        def compare(x, y):
            return int(y+x) - int(x+y)
        
        # Convert integers to strings
        nums = list(map(str, nums))
        
        # Sort the strings using the custom comparison function
        nums.sort(key=cmp_to_key(compare))
        
        # Join the sorted strings to form the largest number
        result = ''.join(nums)
        
        # Remove leading zeros
        result = result.lstrip('0')
        
        # If result is empty, return '0'
        return result if result else '0'
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `largestNumber` function, which takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
    
2.  Inside the function, we define a custom comparison function `compare` using `cmp_to_key` from the `functools` module. This function compares two numbers `x` and `y` by concatenating them in different orders and comparing the resulting integers. We want to sort the numbers in descending order of their concatenation, so that we get the largest number first.
    
3.  We convert the integers in `nums` to strings using `map` and `str`.
    
4.  We sort the strings in `nums` using the custom comparison function `compare` as the key. This sorts the strings in descending order, with the largest number coming first.
    
5.  We join the sorted strings using `join` to form the largest number.
    
6.  We remove any leading zeros from the result using `lstrip` function.
    
7.  Finally, we return the result as a string. If the result is empty (i.e., all numbers in `nums` were zero), we return '0' as the largest number.

Sure! Here's the code for the "Reconstruct Itinerary" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        # Create a dictionary to store the graph as adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Populate the graph with tickets
        for ticket in tickets:
            src, dest = ticket
            graph[src].append(dest)
        
        # Sort the destinations in lexicographical order
        for src in graph:
            graph[src].sort()
        
        # Initialize an empty list to store the itinerary
        itinerary = []
        
        # Function to perform depth-first search to find itinerary
        def dfs(node):
            while graph[node]:
                dfs(graph[node].pop(0))
            itinerary.append(node)
        
        # Start the search from "JFK" as the source
        dfs("JFK")
        
        # Reverse the itinerary to get the correct order
        return itinerary[::-1]
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `findItinerary` function, which takes a list of lists of strings `tickets` as input.
    
2.  Inside the function, we create a dictionary `graph` to store the graph as an adjacency list. The keys of the dictionary represent the source airports, and the values are lists of destination airports.
    
3.  We populate the `graph` dictionary with the tickets by iterating through the `tickets` list. For each ticket, we extract the source and destination airports, and append the destination to the list of destinations for the source airport in the `graph` dictionary.
    
4.  We sort the destinations for each source airport in lexicographical order, as per the problem requirement.
    
5.  We define a helper function `dfs` that performs depth-first search to find the itinerary. The function takes a node (airport) as input and recursively visits its destinations in the `graph` dictionary.
    
6.  Inside the `dfs` function, we use a while loop to continue visiting the destinations until there are no more destinations left for the current node. We pop the first destination from the list of destinations for the current node in the `graph` dictionary, and recursively call the `dfs` function with the popped destination as the new node.
    
7.  We append the current node to the `itinerary` list after visiting all its destinations, which ensures that the itinerary is constructed in reverse order.
    
8.  We start the search from the source airport "JFK" by calling the `dfs` function with "JFK" as the initial node.
    
9.  Finally, we return the constructed `itinerary` list in reverse order to get the correct order of airports to visit.

> Wildcard Matching

Here's the code for the "Wildcard Matching" problem on LeetCode:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize pointers for both strings
        i, j = 0, 0
        # Initialize markers for the last wildcard '*' encountered and the corresponding
        # character index in the string
        last_star, last_star_match = -1, -1
        # Loop through the string and pattern
        while i < len(s):
            # If the characters match or the pattern has a '?', move both pointers
            if j < len(p) and (s[i] == p[j] or p[j] == '?'):
                i += 1
                j += 1
            # If the pattern has a '*', mark the '*' as the last wildcard encountered,
            # and store the corresponding character index in the string
            elif j < len(p) and p[j] == '*':
                last_star = j
                last_star_match = i
                j += 1
            # If the characters don't match and there is no wildcard '*', backtrack
            # to the last '*' encountered and try matching from the character after it
            elif last_star != -1:
                j = last_star + 1
                last_star_match += 1
                i = last_star_match
            # If there is no wildcard '*' and characters don't match, return False
            else:
                return False
        
        # Skip any remaining '*' in the pattern
        while j < len(p) and p[j] == '*':
            j += 1
        
        # If pattern is fully traversed and no mismatch found, return True
        return j == len(p)
```

Explanation:

1.  We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `isMatch` function, which takes two strings `s` and `p` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `s` matches the pattern `p`.
    
2.  We initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `s` and `p` respectively, and two markers `last_star` and `last_star_match` to keep track of the last wildcard '\*' encountered in `p` and the corresponding character index in `s`.
    
3.  We loop through `s` using the `i` pointer and `p` using the `j` pointer.
    
4.  For each character in `s` and `p`, we compare them. If they match or `p` has a '?', we move both pointers `i` and `j` forward.
    
5.  If `p` has a '_', we mark the '_' as the last wildcard encountered (`last_star`), and store the corresponding character index in `s` as `last_star_match`. We also move the `j` pointer forward.
    
6.  If the characters don't match and there is no wildcard '_', we backtrack to the last '_' encountered in `p` by setting `j` to `last_star + 1`, and try matching from the character after `last_star_match` in `s` by setting `i` to `last_star_match + 1`.
    
7.  If there is no wildcard '\*' and characters don't match, we return False, as the pattern does not match the string.
    
8.  After traversing `s`, we skip any remaining '\*' in `p` by moving the `j` pointer forward until the end of `p`.
    
9.  If `p` is fully traversed and no mismatch found, we return True, indicating that the pattern matches the string.
