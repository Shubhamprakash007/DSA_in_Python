> explain dynamic programming in detail using python code
> 
> Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping sub-problems, storing the solution to each sub-problem, and using the solutions to build up to an optimal solution for the original problem. The key idea is to avoid redundant work by remembering the solutions to sub-problems we have already solved and reusing them.

>     if n <= 1:
>         return n
>     if n not in memo:
>         memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
>     return memo[n]
> 
> print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
> ```
> 
> In this example, we use a dictionary `memo` to store the solutions to sub-problems. If the solution to a sub-problem is not yet stored in `memo`, we recursively solve the sub-problem and store the solution in `memo`. If the solution is already stored, we simply return it. This way, we only solve each sub-problem once and use the stored solutions to build up to the solution to the original problem.

> There are two types of knapsack problems:
> 
> 1.  0/1 Knapsack Problem: In this problem, we have a knapsack with a fixed capacity and a set of items, each with a weight and a value. We need to determine which items to put into the knapsack such that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity and the total value is maximized. In this problem, we can either take an item or leave it. We cannot take a fraction of it.
>     
> 2.  Continuous/Fractional Knapsack Problem: In this problem, we can take a fraction of an item, not just all or nothing. The goal is still to maximize the total value while keeping the total weight within the knapsack's capacity.

> 
> 1.  Overlapping sub-problems: The problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems that overlap, meaning that the solution to one sub-problem can be used as part of the solution to another sub-problem.
>     
> 2.  Optimal substructure: The solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to sub-problems.
>

>     
> 
> If a problem meets these criteria, it is likely a good candidate for a dynamic programming solution. Additionally, dynamic programming problems are often optimization problems with an inherent recursive structure, such as the traveling salesman problem, the longest common subsequence problem, or the knapsack problem.

> discuss 0-1 knapsack in detail and give python code for it and explain it with example
> 
> The 0/1 knapsack problem is a classic dynamic programming problem where you have a knapsack with a fixed capacity and a set of items, each with a weight and a value. The goal is to determine which items to put into the knapsack such that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity and the total value is maximized. In this problem, we can either take an item or leave it. We cannot take a fraction of it.

> In this example, `val` is an array representing the value of each item, `wt` is an array representing the weight of each item, `W` is the capacity of the knapsack, and `n` is the number of items. The `knapsack` function returns the maximum value that can be put in the knapsack.
> 
> The algorithm uses a two-dimensional table `K` to store the maximum value that can be achieved with a certain weight and number of items. The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, with `K[i][w]` representing the maximum value that can be achieved with a knapsack of capacity `w` using the first `i` items. If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current knapsack capacity, we have the option of either taking the item (`val[i-1] + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]]`) or leaving it (`K[i-1][w]`). If the weight of the current item is greater than the current knapsack capacity, we must leave it. The final result is stored in `K[n][W]`, which represents the maximum value that can be achieved using all `n` items with a knapsack of capacity `W`.

> The "equal sum partition problem" is to determine if a given set of positive integers can be divided into two subsets such that the sum of elements in each subset is equal.
> 
> In the code `equalSumPartition(arr)`, `arr` is the input array of positive integers. `n` is the length of the input array. `S` is the sum of all elements in `arr`.
> 
> The code first checks if `S` is odd or not. If `S` is odd, the function returns False since it is not possible to divide the elements into two equal subsets.
> 
> If `S` is even, it calculates `S` as half of the sum of all elements. It initializes a 2D boolean array `dp` with dimensions (n + 1) x (S + 1) to store the results of subproblems.
> 
> The first for loop sets `dp[i][0]` to `True` for all `i` from 0 to n, as a subset with sum 0 can always be formed with an empty set.
> 
> The second for loop sets `dp[0][i]` to `False` for all `i` from 1 to S, as it is not possible to form a subset with sum `i` with an empty set.
> 
> The next two nested for loops fill in the rest of the `dp` array using bottom-up dynamic programming. The logic is as follows:
> 
> *   If the current element's weight (`arr[i-1]`) is greater than the remaining capacity (`j`), we can't include it in the current subset and the value of `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i-1][j]`.
> *   If the current element's weight is less than or equal to the remaining capacity, we have two choices:
>     *   Either include the current element in the current subset and subtract its weight from the remaining capacity, or
>     *   exclude the current element and keep the remaining capacity unchanged. The value of `dp[i][j]` is set to `True` if either of the above conditions results in a subset with sum `j`.
>
