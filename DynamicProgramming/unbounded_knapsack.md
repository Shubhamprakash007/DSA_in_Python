> what is unbounded knapsack what problems comes under this
> 
> The unbounded knapsack problem is a variation of the classic knapsack problem in which there is no limit to the number of items that can be taken from each category. It is an optimization problem that asks to maximize the total value of items placed into a knapsack of limited capacity. The problem can be formulated as follows: given a set of items with weights and values, and a knapsack with a maximum capacity, find the combination of items such that their total weight is less than or equal to the knapsack capacity and their total value is maximized.
> 
> The unbounded knapsack problem is a type of 0/1 knapsack problem, which is NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution is computationally expensive for large instances. Some variations of the unbounded knapsack problem include the fractional knapsack problem, where items can be taken in fractional amounts, and the multiple knapsack problem, where there are multiple knapsacks with different capacities.

> This implementation uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where the values of `dp[i]` represent the maximum value that can be achieved with a knapsack of capacity `i`. For each item `j`, we check if its weight `wt[j]` is less than or equal to the current capacity `i`, and if so, update `dp[i]` with the maximum value between its current value and the value obtained by taking item `j` plus the maximum value that can be achieved with a knapsack of capacity `i - wt[j]`. Finally, the function returns `dp[w]`, which is the maximum value that can be achieved with a knapsack of capacity `w`.

> define rod cutting problem . what should be our approch to solve this problem
> 
> The rod cutting problem is an optimization problem that asks to determine the maximum profit that can be made by cutting a rod into smaller pieces and selling them. The length of the rod, the prices of the smaller pieces, and the optimal way to cut the rod to maximize the profit are given as inputs to the problem.
> 
> The approach to solve the rod cutting problem can be done using dynamic programming. The key idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and solve each subproblem only once. The solution to each subproblem is then stored and reused to solve larger subproblems.
> 
> To solve the rod cutting problem using dynamic programming, we can use the following steps:
> 
> 1.  Define an array `dp` to store the maximum profit that can be made for each length of the rod.
>     
> 2.  Initialize the `dp` array with the price of the pieces of the same length as the rod, as this would represent the maximum profit if the rod was not cut at all.
>     
> 3.  Loop through the lengths of the rod from `1` to `n`, where `n` is the length of the rod. For each length `i`, loop through the possible cuts `j` from `1` to `i`.
>     
> 4.  For each cut `j`, calculate the profit obtained by selling the piece of length `j` and the remaining piece of length `i - j`. The profit for a cut `j` can be calculated as `p[j] + dp[i - j]`, where `p[j]` is the price of the piece of length `j`.
>     
> 5.  For each length `i`, find the maximum profit obtained from all the possible cuts and store it in `dp[i]`.
>     
> 6.  Finally, the maximum profit can be found at `dp[n]`, which represents the maximum profit that can be made by cutting the rod of length `n`.
