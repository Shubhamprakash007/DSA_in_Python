> 1.  Data Structures:
>     
>     *   Arrays
>     *   Linked Lists
>     *   Stacks and Queues
>     *   Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Trie, Segment Trees, etc.)
>     *   Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
>     *   Graphs (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, A\* Algorithm, etc.)
>     *   Hash Tables
>     *   Dynamic Programming
> 2.  Algorithms:
>     
>     *   Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort, BubbleSort, etc.)
>     *   Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
>     *   Recursion
>     *   Divide and Conquer
>     *   Greedy Algorithms
>     *   Backtracking
>     *   Bit Manipulation
> 
> Additionally, it is important to have a strong understanding of computer science fundamentals such as Time and Space Complexity analysis, Big-O notation, and basic programming concepts such as memory management, I/O operations, etc.
