> The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classical computer science problem that involves finding the longest common subsequence between two sequences, such as strings, arrays, or lists. A common subsequence is a sequence of elements that appear in the same order in both input sequences. The goal of LCS is to find the longest such sequence, so it can be used in various applications, such as sequence alignment, text comparison, and gene sequence analysis.

> The Longest Common Substring (LCS) problem is a classical computer science problem that involves finding the longest common contiguous substring between two strings. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, while a common substring is a substring that appears in both input strings. The goal of the LCS problem is to find the longest such substring, so it can be used in various applications, such as spell checking, text comparison, and DNA sequence analysis.

> *   The function `scs` takes two input strings `X` and `Y`.
> *   It starts by initializing a 2D dp array `dp` with the length of the two strings `X` and `Y`.
> *   It then uses a bottom-up approach to fill the dp array. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, it checks if the last characters of `X[:i]` and `Y[:j]` match. If they match, it sets the value in the cell to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. If they don't match, it sets the value in the cell to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.
> *   After the dp array is filled, the function initializes variables `i`, `j`, and `index` to the length of the two strings `m`, `n`, and the value of `dp[m][n]` respectively.
> *   The function then uses these variables to follow the dp array starting from the last cell and appending characters to the beginning of the `scs` string. If the last characters of `X[:i]` and `Y[:j]` match, it appends the matching character to the beginning of `scs` and decrements both `i` and `j`. If they don't match, it appends the character from the string with the larger value in the dp array to the beginning of `scs` and decrements either `i` or `j` depending on which string has the larger value

> 
> The function `lcs` computes the length of the LCS of `X` and `Y`. The function takes the strings `X` and `Y` and their lengths `m` and `n` as input. It initializes a 2-D array `L` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0. It then loops over the indices of `X` and `Y` and updates the elements of `L` using the following logic:
> 
> *   If `X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]`, then `L[i][j] = L[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. This means that `X[i - 1]` and `Y[j - 1]` are part of the LCS, so their contribution to the length of LCS is added to the previous value.
> *   If `X[i - 1] != Y[j - 1]`, then `L[i][j] = max(L[i - 1][j], L[i][j - 1])`. This means that `X[i - 1]` and `Y[j - 1]` are not part of the LCS, so the length of LCS is the maximum of the lengths of LCS of subproblems `X[0...i-1]` and `Y[0...j-1]` and `X[0...i]` and `Y[0...j-1]`.

> The function `min_insertions_deletions` takes the strings `X` and `Y` as input, computes their lengths `m` and `n`, and then computes the length of the LCS of `X` and `Y` using the `lcs` function. The minimum number of insertions and deletions required to convert `X` to `Y` is given by `(m - lcs_len) + (n - lcs_len)`, where `lcs_len` is the length of LCS. The function returns this value.

> 
> The `min_insertions_deletions` function uses the length of the LCS, `lcs_len`, to calculate the minimum number of insertions and deletions needed to convert string `X` to string `Y`.
> 
> The result is obtained by subtracting the length of LCS from the length of both strings and summing the results, i.e., (m - lcs\_len) + (n - lcs\_len). This gives us the minimum number of characters that need to be inserted or deleted from string `X` and `Y` to make them equal.

> 1.  `new_string = "#".join("^{}$".format(string))` - In this line, the input string is transformed into a new string by adding a '^' symbol at the start and a '$' symbol at the end. The original string characters are separated by the '#' symbol. The purpose of this transformation is to handle even length palindromes and to make it easier to process the string.

>     
> 4.  `center = 0` and `max_right = 0` - `center` and `max_right` are two variables that keep track of the center of the palindromic substring that has the largest right edge.
>     
> 5.  `max_length = 0` - `max_length` is a variable that stores the length of the longest palindromic substring.
>     
> 6.  `for i in range(1, n - 1):` - This loop iterates over each character of the transformed string, starting from the second character and ending at the second last character.
>     
> 7.  `if i < max_right:` - If the current character is inside the largest palindromic substring found so far, its radius can be calculated using the symmetry property of palindromes.
>     
> 8.  `radius[i] = min(max_right - i, radius[2 * center - i])` - This line calculates the radius of the current character using the symmetry property. The value of `radius[i]` is equal to the minimum of `max_right - i` and `radius[2 * center - i]`.
>     
> 9.  `while new_string[i + 1 + radius[i]] == new_string[i - 1 - radius[i]]:` - This loop checks if the characters on both sides of the current character form a palindromic substring. If they do, the radius of the current character is incremented by 1.
>     
> 10.  `if i + radius[i] > max_right:` - If the right edge of the current palindromic substring extends beyond the right edge of the largest palindromic substring found so far, the center and the right edge of the largest palindromic substring are updated.
>     
> 11.  `center = i` and `max_right = i + radius[i]` - The center and the right edge of the largest palindromic substring are updated.
