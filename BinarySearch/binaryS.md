Binary search is a search algorithm that is used to find a particular value in a sorted list or array. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, and comparing the value you are searching for to the middle element of the interval. If the value is less than the middle element, then the search continues on the lower half of the interval; if it is greater than the middle element, then the search continues on the upper half of the interval. This process is repeated until the value is found, or until the search interval is empty.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the binary search algorithm:

1.  Given a sorted list or array of values, set the lower and upper bounds of the search interval to the first and last indices of the list, respectively.
2.  Calculate the middle index of the search interval by taking the average of the lower and upper bounds (i.e., middle\_index = (lower\_bound + upper\_bound) / 2).
3.  Compare the value you are searching for to the middle element of the search interval.
4.  If the value is equal to the middle element, then you have found the value and can return its index.
5.  If the value is less than the middle element, then set the upper bound of the search interval to the index immediately below the middle index, and repeat steps 2-4 with the new search interval.
6.  If the value is greater than the middle element, then set the lower bound of the search interval to the index immediately above the middle index, and repeat steps 2-4 with the new search interval.
7.  If the search interval is empty (i.e., the lower bound is greater than the upper bound), then the value was not found in the list.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

> what are all the different types of binary search problems

There are several different types of binary search problems that you may encounter. Here are a few examples:

1.  Basic binary search: This is the simplest form of binary search, where you are given a sorted list of values and asked to find a specific value in the list.
    
2.  Search for a range: In this type of problem, you are given a sorted list of values and asked to find the first and last indices of a specific value in the list. This can be done using binary search to find the first occurrence of the value, and then again to find the last occurrence.
    
3.  Rotated sorted array: In a rotated sorted array, the elements of a sorted array are rotated by some unknown amount. In this type of problem, you are given a rotated sorted array and asked to find a specific value in the array. This can be done using a modified version of binary search that takes into account the rotation.
    
4.  Minimum/maximum element: In this type of problem, you are given a sorted array that has been rotated by an unknown amount, and asked to find the minimum or maximum element in the array. This can be done using a modified version of binary search that takes into account the rotation.
    
5.  Median of two sorted arrays: In this type of problem, you are given two sorted arrays of equal length and asked to find the median of the two arrays. This can be done using a modified version of binary search that compares the medians of the two arrays and recursively divides the arrays until the median is found.
    
6.  Allocate minimum number of pages: In this type of problem, you are given a list of books with the number of pages in each book, and you are asked to allocate the books to a given number of students in such a way that the maximum number of pages allocated to any student is minimized. This can be solved using a modified version of binary search that tries different allocation strategies and finds the minimum value that satisfies the allocation constraints.
    

These are just a few examples of the different types of binary search problems you may encounter. The key to solving binary search problems is to identify the pattern or property of the input that allows you to use binary search, and then carefully apply the algorithm to the problem.

> give general python template for each category with slight modification will able to solve all problems of that category

Sure, here are some general Python templates for each category of binary search problems:

1.  Basic binary search:

vbnet

```vbnet
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return -1  # target not found
```

2.  Search for a range:

python

```python
def search_range(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    # find the first occurrence of target
    first = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            first = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    if first == -1:
        return [-1, -1]  # target not found
    
    # find the last occurrence of target
    low, high = first, len(arr) - 1
    last = first
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            last = mid
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return [first, last]
```

3.  Rotated sorted array:

vbnet

```vbnet
def search_rotated_sorted_array(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] >= arr[low]:
            if target >= arr[low] and target < arr[mid]:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        else:
            if target <= arr[high] and target > arr[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
                
    return -1  # target not found
```

4.  Minimum/maximum element:

vbnet

```vbnet
def find_minimum_element(arr):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < arr[high]:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
            
    return arr[low]
```

vbnet

```vbnet
def find_maximum_element(arr):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > arr[low]:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return arr[low]
```

5.  Median of two sorted arrays:

python

```python
def find_median_sorted_arrays(nums1, nums2):
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1  # make sure nums1 is the shorter array
    
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    imin, imax = 0, m
    
    while imin <= imax:
        i = (imin + imax) // 2
        j =
```

> continue

less

    ```less
half_len = (m + n + 1) // 2 - i
    
    if i < m and nums2[half_len - 1] > nums1[i]:
        imin = i + 1
    elif i > 0 and nums1[i - 1] > nums2[half_len]:
        imax = i - 1
    else:
        if i == 0:
            max_left = nums2[half_len - 1]
        elif half_len == 0:
            max_left = nums1[i - 1]
        else:
            max_left = max(nums1[i - 1], nums2[half_len - 1])
            
        if (m + n) % 2 == 1:
            return max_left
        
        if i == m:
            min_right = nums2[half_len]
        elif half_len == n:
            min_right = nums1[i]
        else:
            min_right = min(nums1[i], nums2[half_len])
            
        return (max_left + min_right) / 2.0
```

I hope these templates help you to solve binary search problems in Python!
```

> also give template of 6th category

Sure, here is a general Python template for the 6th category of binary search problems, which involves using binary search to solve a problem that doesn't directly involve searching for a value in an array:

6.  Miscellaneous binary search problems:

python

```python
def binary_search_misc():
    # initialize low and high pointers
    low, high = 0, 1000
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # perform some check or computation
        result = check(mid)
        
        # update low and high pointers based on result
        if result == 0:
            return mid  # found the solution
        elif result < 0:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
            
    return -1  # solution not found
```

In this template, the `check()` function is where the actual computation or problem-solving happens, and it returns a value that tells us whether we should move the low or high pointer. The `binary_search_misc()` function takes care of initializing the pointers and calling `check()` repeatedly until the solution is found or it determines that there is no solution. You would need to modify this template for each specific problem by defining the `check()` function appropriately.

> also give template for Allocate minimum number of pages

Sure, here's a Python template for the "Allocate minimum number of pages" problem:

python

```python
def allocate_minimum_pages(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < k:
        return -1
    
    # initialize low and high pointers
    low, high = max(arr), sum(arr)
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # check if it's possible to divide array into k subarrays with max sum <= mid
        num_partitions = count_partitions(arr, mid)
        
        # update low and high pointers based on result
        if num_partitions <= k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
            
    return low

def count_partitions(arr, max_sum):
    num_partitions = 1
    current_sum = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x > max_sum:
            return float('inf')
        if current_sum + x <= max_sum:
            current_sum += x
        else:
            num_partitions += 1
            current_sum = x
    return num_partitions
```

In this template, the `allocate_minimum_pages()` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` and returns the minimum possible maximum sum of any partition of `arr` with exactly `k` partitions. The function first initializes the low and high pointers based on the minimum and maximum possible values of the maximum sum, respectively. It then uses binary search to narrow down the possible range of values for the maximum sum.

The `count_partitions()` function is used within the binary search loop to determine whether it's possible to divide the array `arr` into `k` partitions with maximum sum less than or equal to `mid`. It returns the number of partitions needed to do so. If it's not possible to divide the array into `k` partitions with maximum sum less than or equal to `mid`, it returns infinity.

You can modify this template to solve variations of the problem that involve different constraints or requirements.

Again, these are just some examples, and there are many other binary search problems out there that fall into these categories or variations of them.

> give template for Classical binary search problems such that with slight modification will able to solve all problems of this category

Sure, here's a Python template for the Classical binary search problems:

sql

```sql
def binary_search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return -1
```

In this template, the `binary_search()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target` and returns the index of the target value in the array, or -1 if it's not found. The function initializes the left and right pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively, and uses binary search to narrow down the possible range of indices that could contain the target value.

You can modify this template to solve variations of the Classical binary search problem that involve different constraints or requirements. For example, if the array is rotated and sorted, you can modify the `binary_search()` function to find the minimum element in the array:

sql

```sql
def find_min(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
            
    return nums[left]
```

In this modified template, the `find_min()` function takes a rotated and sorted array `nums` and returns the minimum element in the array. The function initializes the left and right pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively, and uses binary search to narrow down the possible range of indices that could contain the minimum element.

You can similarly modify this template to solve other variations of the Classical binary search problem.

> give general template for Binary search on answer problem

Sure, here's a Python template for the Binary search on answer problems:

sql

```sql
def binary_search_on_answer(nums, left, right):
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if is_valid(nums, mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return left
```

In this template, the `binary_search_on_answer()` function takes an array `nums`, a left pointer `left`, and a right pointer `right`, and returns the answer to the problem using binary search. The `is_valid()` function is a helper function that checks whether a given answer is valid, and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

To use this template to solve a Binary search on answer problem, you would need to modify the `is_valid()` function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Split Array Largest Sum" problem, the `is_valid()` function would check whether it is possible to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum less than or equal to the given mid value:

python

```python
def is_valid(nums, mid, m):
    count = 1
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
        if total > mid:
            count += 1
            total = num
            if count > m:
                return False
    
    return True
```

In this modified template, the `is_valid()` function takes an array `nums`, a mid value `mid`, and an integer `m`, and returns `True` if it is possible to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum less than or equal to `mid` and the total number of subarrays is less than or equal to `m`. The function uses a count variable to keep track of the number of subarrays, and a total variable to keep track of the sum of elements in each subarray.

You can modify this template and the `is_valid()` function to solve other variations of the Binary search on answer problem.

> give general template for Floor and ceiling values problems

Sure, here's a Python template for the Floor and Ceiling values problems:

python

```python
def floor_ceiling(nums, target):
    # Find the index of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    floor_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] <= target:
            floor_idx = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    # Find the index of the smallest element larger than or equal to the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    ceiling_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            ceiling_idx = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return (floor_idx, ceiling_idx)
```

In this template, the `floor_ceiling()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns a tuple containing the indices of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target (the floor value) and the smallest element larger than or equal to the target (the ceiling value).

To use this template to solve a specific Floor and Ceiling values problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Find K Closest Elements" problem, you would need to modify the function to return the K closest elements to the target value:

python

```python
def find_k_closest(nums, target, k):
    # Find the index of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    floor_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] <= target:
            floor_idx = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    # Find the index of the smallest element larger than the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    ceiling_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            ceiling_idx = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # Use the two indices to find the K closest elements to the target
    result = []
    while len(result) < k:
        if floor_idx < 0:
            result.append(nums[ceiling_idx])
            ceiling_idx += 1
        elif ceiling_idx >= len(nums):
            result.append(nums[floor_idx])
            floor_idx -= 1
        elif abs(nums[floor_idx] - target) <= abs(nums[ceiling_idx] - target):
            result.append(nums[floor_idx])
            floor_idx -= 1
        else:
            result.append(nums[ceiling_idx])
            ceiling_idx += 1
    
    result.sort()
    return result
```

In this modified template, the `find_k_closest()` function takes an array `nums`, a target value `target`, and an integer `k`, and returns an array containing the `k` closest elements to the target value. The function uses the `floor_ceiling()` function to find the indices of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target and the smallest element larger than the target, and then uses a while loop to iterate through the two

> give general template for First occurrence and last occurrence problems

Sure, here's a Python template for the First occurrence and Last occurrence problems:

sql

```sql
def first_last_occurrence(nums, target):
    # Find the first occurrence of the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    first_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            if nums[mid] == target:
                first_occurrence = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # Find the last occurrence of the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    last_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] <= target:
            if nums[mid] == target:
                last_occurrence = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return (first_occurrence, last_occurrence)
```

In this template, the `first_last_occurrence()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns a tuple containing the index of the first occurrence of the target and the index of the last occurrence of the target.

To use this template to solve a specific First occurrence or Last occurrence problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Search Insert Position" problem, you would need to modify the function to return the index where the target should be inserted if it is not present in the array:

sql

```sql
def search_insert(nums, target):
    # Find the first occurrence of the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    first_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            if nums[mid] == target:
                first_occurrence = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # If the target is found, return its index
    if first_occurrence != -1:
        return first_occurrence
    
    # If the target is not found, return the index where it should be inserted
    return left
```

In this modified template, the `search_insert()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns the index where the target should be inserted if it is not present in the array. The function uses the `first_last_occurrence()` function to find the index of the first occurrence of the target, and then returns this index if it is found. If the target is not found, the function returns the index where the target should be inserted, which is the value of `left` after the binary search loop.

> give general template for Searching in 2D matrix problems

Sure, here's a Python template for Searching in 2D matrix problems:

sql

```sql
def search_matrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    left, right = 0, m*n-1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        i, j = mid // n, mid % n
        
        if matrix[i][j] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[i][j] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return False
```

In this template, the `search_matrix()` function takes a 2D matrix `matrix` and a target value `target`, and returns `True` if the target value is present in the matrix, and `False` otherwise.

The template works by treating the 2D matrix as a 1D array, and performing a binary search on the 1D array. To do this, we use two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the start and end of the 1D array. We initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `m*n-1`, where `m` is the number of rows in the matrix and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.

In each iteration of the binary search loop, we compute the middle index `mid` of the 1D array, and convert it to a 2D index `(i, j)` using integer division and modulo operations. We then compare the value at the `(i, j)` index of the matrix to the target value, and update the pointers `left` and `right` accordingly.

If the target value is found in the matrix, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the binary search loop terminates and the target value is not found in the matrix, the function returns `False`.

To use this template to solve a specific Searching in 2D matrix problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Search a 2D Matrix II" problem, you would need to modify the function to account for the fact that the matrix is sorted both horizontally and vertically:

python

```python
def search_matrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    i, j = 0, n-1
    
    while i < m and j >= 0:
        if matrix[i][j] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[i][j] < target:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
            
    return False
```

In this modified template, the `search_matrix()` function takes a 2D matrix `matrix` and a target value `target`, and returns `True` if the target value is present in the matrix, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a two-pointer approach, starting at the top-right corner of the matrix and moving left or down depending on whether the current value is greater or less than the target value. This approach takes advantage of the fact that the matrix is sorted both horizontally and vertically, and allows us to eliminate entire rows or columns of the matrix with each comparison. If the target value is found in the matrix, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the two-pointer loop terminates and the target value is not found in the matrix, the function returns `False`.

> give general template for misllenious binary search problems

Sure, here's a Python template for miscellaneous binary search problems:

sql

```sql
def binary_search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            # Target found, return mid or do some processing
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            # Target is to the right of mid, search right half
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # Target is to the left of mid, search left half
            right = mid - 1
            
    # Target not found
    return -1
```

In this template, the `binary_search()` function takes a sorted list of numbers `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns the index of the target value in the list if it is present, or `-1` if it is not.

The template works by initializing two pointers `left` and `right` to the start and end of the list, respectively. In each iteration of the binary search loop, we compute the middle index `mid` of the list using integer division, and compare the value at the `mid` index to the target value. If the value at the `mid` index is equal to the target value, we have found the target and return the `mid` index (or do some other processing). Otherwise, we update the pointers `left` and `right` based on whether the target value is to the left or right of the `mid` index, and continue the binary search.

To use this template to solve a specific miscellaneous binary search problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Find Peak Element" problem, which asks you to find any peak element in an unsorted array (where a peak element is defined as an element that is greater than its neighbors), you could modify the function as follows:

sql

```sql
def find_peak_element(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]:
            # Peak is to the left of mid, search left half
            right = mid
        else:
            # Peak is to the right of mid, search right half
            left = mid + 1
            
    # left pointer now points to a peak element
    return left
```

In this modified template, the `find_peak_element()` function takes an unsorted list of numbers `nums` and returns the index of any peak element in the list. The function uses a modified binary search approach where we compare the value at the `mid` index to its neighbor to the right. If the value at the `mid` index is greater than its neighbor to the right, we know that a peak element must exist to the left of `mid`, so we search the left half of the list. Otherwise, the peak element must exist to the right of `mid`, so we search the right half of the list. We continue this process until we have found a peak element, which will be located at the `left` pointer.

> give code for binary serach on reverse sorted arry

Sure! Here's an example Python code for binary search on a reverse sorted array:

sql

```sql
def binary_search_reverse(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            # Target found, return mid or do some processing
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            # Target is to the left of mid, search left half
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            # Target is to the right of mid, search right half
            left = mid + 1
            
    # Target not found
    return -1
```

In this code, the function `binary_search_reverse()` takes a reverse sorted list of numbers `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns the index of the target value in the list if it is present, or `-1` if it is not.

The template is similar to a standard binary search algorithm, but with a slight modification in the conditional statements. If the middle element `nums[mid]` is less than the target value `target`, it means that the target value is actually in the left half of the array, because the array is sorted in reverse order. So, we update the `right` pointer to be `mid - 1`. Conversely, if the middle element is greater than the target value, we update the `left` pointer to be `mid + 1`.

To use this function, you can simply call `binary_search_reverse()` with your reverse sorted array and the target value you want to search for, like this:

scss

```scss
reverse_sorted_array = [9, 7, 5, 4, 2]
target_value = 5

result = binary_search_reverse(reverse_sorted_array, target_value)
print(result)
```

This code will output `2`, which is the index of the target value `5` in the reverse sorted array.

    # Check if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order
    is_ascending = nums[left] < nums[right]
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            # Target found, return mid or do some processing
            return mid
        elif is_ascending:
            if nums[mid] < target:
                # Target is to the right of mid, search right half
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                # Target is to the left of mid, search left half
                right = mid - 1
        else:
            if nums[mid] < target:
                # Target is to the left of mid, search left half
                right = mid - 1

                left = mid + 1
            
    # Target not found

> Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array class Solution: def searchRange(self, nums: List\[int\], target: int) -> List\[int\]: #complete this code

Sure! Here's the Python code to solve the "Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array" problem using a modified binary search approach:

sql

```sql
class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize variables to store the first and last occurrence of target in nums
        first_occurrence, last_occurrence = -1, -1
        
        # Use binary search to find the first occurrence of target in nums
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                first_occurrence = mid
                right = mid - 1
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        # Use binary search to find the last occurrence of target in nums
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                last_occurrence = mid
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        # Return the first and last occurrence of target in nums
        return [first_occurrence, last_occurrence]
```

In this code, the `searchRange()` function takes a list of integers `nums`

> 2 / 2
> 
> is there any more consice version of the code

Yes, there is a more concise version of the code that also runs in O(log n) time complexity. Here it is:

python

```python
class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize variables to store the first and last occurrence of target in nums
        left = bisect_left(nums, target)
        right = bisect_right(nums, target) - 1
        
        # Check if the target is not present in nums
        if left >= len(nums) or nums[left] != target:
            return [-1, -1]
        
        # Return the first and last occurrence of target in nums
        return [left, right]
```

In this code, the `searchRange()` function uses the `bisect_left()` and `bisect_right()` functions from the `bisect` module of Python's standard library. These functions perform binary search on the sorted list `nums` and return the indices of the first and last occurrences of `target`. We subtract 1 from the index returned by `bisect_right()` to get the index of the last occurrence.

We also check if the target is not present in `nums` by checking if the index returned by `bisect_left()` is out of range or if the element at that index is not equal to `target`. If either of these conditions is true, we return `[-1, -1]` to indicate that the target is not present in `nums`.

> can you tell me more about bisect\_left and bisect\_right library function in which module it is present

`bisect_left()` and `bisect_right()` are two functions provided by the `bisect` module of Python's standard library. They perform binary search on a sorted list to find the index where a given element should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

`bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))` finds the leftmost index `i` such that `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`. If all elements in the list are less than `x`, the function returns `hi`. The optional arguments `lo` and `hi` specify the slice of the list to search, with `lo` and `hi` defaulting to the start and end of the list, respectively.

`bisect_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))` is similar to `bisect_left()`, but finds the rightmost index `i` such that `a[i]` is greater than `x`. If all elements in the list are less than or equal to `x`, the function returns `hi`.

Both functions assume that the input list `a` is sorted in non-descending order. If the list is not sorted, the behavior of these functions is undefined.

These functions are very useful for performing binary search on sorted lists in Python. They have a time complexity of O(log n), which makes them efficient for large lists.

> so we have to import bisect module

Yes, you need to import the `bisect` module in order to use `bisect_left()` and `bisect_right()` functions. Here is an example of how to import the module:

python

```python
import bisect

# Example usage of bisect_left()
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
x = 4
i = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
print(i)  # Output: 3

# Example usage of bisect_right()
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
x = 4
i = bisect.bisect_right(a, x)
print(i)  # Output: 5
```

In this example, we first import the `bisect` module using the `import` statement. We then use the `bisect_left()` function to find the index of the leftmost occurrence of the element `x` in the list `a`. We also use the `bisect_right()` function to find the index of the rightmost occurrence of `x` in `a`.

Note that we have to prefix the function names with the module name (`bisect`) when calling them, as they are part of the `bisect` module.

> code for number of times a sorted array is rotated and also practice link if availabe

Here's the code for finding the number of times a sorted array is rotated:

python

```python
def find_rotation_count(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    low, high = 0, n - 1

    while low <= high:
        # Case 1: array is already sorted
        if arr[low] <= arr[high]:
            return low

        mid = (low + high) // 2
        prev = (mid + n - 1) % n
        nxt = (mid + 1) % n

        # Case 2: mid is the pivot element
        if arr[mid] <= arr[prev] and arr[mid] <= arr[nxt]:
            return mid

        # Case 3: pivot element lies to the left of mid
        elif arr[mid] <= arr[high]:
            high = mid - 1

        # Case 4: pivot element lies to the right of mid
        elif arr[mid] >= arr[low]:
            low = mid + 1

    # Array is not rotated
    return -1
```

This code uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the pivot element in a rotated sorted array. The index of the pivot element is the number of times the array has been rotated.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1.  We initialize `low` and `high` as the first and last indices of the array, respectively.
    
2.  We enter a loop that runs until `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
    
3.  Inside the loop, we first check if the array is already sorted. If it is, we return `low`, which is the index of the minimum element in the array.
    
4.  If the array is not sorted, we compute the midpoint `mid` of the array. We also compute the indices of the previous and next elements of `mid` in the circular array using the `%` operator.
    
5.  We check if `mid` is the pivot element. This is the case if `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to both the previous and next elements of `mid` in the circular array. If this is true, we return `mid`, which is the index of the pivot element.
    
6.  If `mid` is not the pivot element, we check if the pivot element lies to the left of `mid`. This is the case if `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `arr[high]`. If this is true, we search the left half of the array by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
    
7.  If the pivot element does not lie to the left of `mid`, it must lie to the right. We search the right half of the array by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
    
8.  If we exit the loop without finding the pivot element, the array is not rotated, so we return `-1`.
    

Here's a sample input and output:

python

```python
arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
count = find_rotation_count(arr)
print(count)  # Output: 4
```

This input array has been rotated four times, so the output is `4`.

You can practice more problems related to binary search on LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces. Here's a link to a LeetCode problem related to finding the rotation count of a sorted array:

*   [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

> arr = \[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2\] can you explain me how this is rotated 4 times

Sure, let me explain how the array \[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2\] is rotated 4 times:

1.  The original sorted array is \[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\].
2.  We start by rotating the array one time to the right, resulting in \[7, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6\].
3.  We continue rotating the array one more time to the right, resulting in \[6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5\].
4.  We rotate the array one more time to the right, resulting in \[5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4\].
5.  Finally, we rotate the array one more time to the right, resulting in \[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2\].

So, the array \[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2\] is a rotated version of the original sorted array, where it has been rotated 4 times to the right.

> give code for search in rotated sorted array

Sure, here's an implementation of search in rotated sorted array using binary search in Python:

sql

```sql
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # First, find the pivot index
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        pivot = left
        
        # Then, perform binary search on the appropriate side of the pivot
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        if target >= nums[pivot] and target <= nums[right]:
            left = pivot
        else:
            right = pivot - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return -1
```

The above code first finds the pivot index by performing binary search on the array. Once the pivot index is found, it checks which side of the pivot the target element lies in and performs binary search on that side of the array.

Here, `nums` is the array that is rotated, and `target` is the element we are searching for in the array.

You can test this implementation using various test cases and modify it according to your needs.

> explain this code

Sure, I'd be happy to explain the code for you.

The given code implements a binary search approach to search for a target element in a rotated sorted array.

First, the code defines a class `Solution` that has a method `search` that takes in two arguments - the rotated sorted array `nums` and the target element `target`. The return value of the method is the index of the target element in the array, or -1 if the element is not found.

The method begins by finding the pivot index of the array - the index at which the array is rotated. This is done by performing a binary search on the array. The binary search algorithm maintains two pointers `left` and `right` that point to the start and end of the array, respectively. In each iteration, the algorithm calculates the middle index `mid` as `(left + right) // 2`, and compares the value at `mid` with the value at `right`.

If the value at `mid` is greater than the value at `right`, it means that the pivot index lies to the right of `mid`, so the algorithm updates `left` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, the pivot index lies to the left of `mid`, so the algorithm updates `right` to `mid`.

Once the pivot index is found, the algorithm checks which side of the array the target element lies in. If the target element lies between the pivot index and the last index of the array, the algorithm sets `left` to the pivot index. Otherwise, the algorithm sets `right` to the pivot index - 1.

The algorithm then performs another binary search on the appropriate side of the array. The binary search algorithm maintains the same two pointers `left` and `right`, and calculates the middle index `mid` in each iteration. If the value at `mid` is equal to the target element, the algorithm returns `mid`. If the value at `mid` is less than the target element, the algorithm updates `left` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, the algorithm updates `right` to `mid - 1`.

If the target element is not found in the array, the algorithm returns -1.

I hope this helps clarify the code for you. Let me know if you have any further questions!

> can you solve it the way you have solved number of times a sorted array is rotated

Sure, I can provide a solution for the problem of searching in a rotated sorted array using the same approach as for finding the number of times a sorted array is rotated.

                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
                    
        return -1
```

The algorithm works by performing a modified binary search on the rotated sorted array.

We initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. In each iteration of the while loop, we calculate the middle index `mid` using `(left + right) // 2`.

If the element at the middle index is equal to the target, we return the middle index.

We then check if the left half of the array is sorted or if the right half of the array is sorted. We check this by comparing the element at the left index with the element at the middle index. If the left element is less than or equal to the middle element, the left half of the array is sorted. Otherwise, the right half of the array is sorted.

If the left half of the array is sorted and the target is within the range of elements in the left half, we search the left half of the array. Otherwise, we search the right half of the array.

If the right half of the array is sorted and the target is within the range of elements in the right half, we search the right half of the array. Otherwise, we search the left half of the array.

If the target is not found in the array, we return -1.

> searching in nearly sorted array

Searching in a nearly sorted array is a problem where the array is almost sorted, but up to k elements may be out of order. The task is to find the index of a given element in the array.

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

sql

```sql
def search(arr, target):
    n = len(arr)
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        if mid > 0 and arr[mid-1] == target:
            return mid-1
        
        if mid < n-1 and arr[mid+1] == target:
            return mid+1
        
        if arr[mid] > target:
            right = mid - 2
        else:
            left = mid + 2
            
    return -1
```

In this solution, we perform a binary search on the nearly sorted array. We first initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.

In each iteration of the while loop, we calculate the middle index `mid` using `(left + right) // 2`.

We then check if the element at the middle index is equal to the target, or if the element at the previous or next indices is equal to the target. If any of these conditions is true, we return the corresponding index.

If the target is not found at any of these indices, we check whether the element at the middle index is greater than or less than the target. If it is greater than the target, we search the left half of the array. Otherwise, we search the right half of the array.

To skip the elements that are out of order, we modify the left and right pointers by adding or subtracting 2 instead of 1. This is because at most k elements are out of order, and if we skip 2 elements at a time, we can guarantee that we will not miss the target.

If the target is not found in the array, we return -1.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

> find floor of an element in a sorted array

To find the floor of an element in a sorted array, we need to find the largest element in the array that is smaller than or equal to the given element. We can use a modified binary search to find the floor.

Here's the Python code to find the floor of an element in a sorted array:

vbnet

```vbnet
def findFloor(arr, target):
    n = len(arr)
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    floor = -1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return arr[mid]
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            floor = arr[mid]
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return floor
```

In this code, `arr` is the input array and `target` is the element whose floor we need to find. We first initialize `low` and `high` as the first and last indices of the array, and set `floor` to -1 (which will be the floor if the target is smaller than the first element of the array).

We then run a modified binary search by calculating the `mid` index, and checking if the element at `mid` is equal to, smaller than, or greater than the target. If the element at `mid` is equal to the target, we return the target itself. If it is smaller than the target, we update the `floor` to the current element at `mid`, and move `low` to `mid + 1`. If it is greater than the target, we move `high` to `mid - 1`.

We keep running the binary search until `low` is greater than `high`, at which point we return the `floor`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

> Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/3445015fda986316bee02154478942ce.py", line 37, in <module> print(str(ans\[0\]) + " " + str(ans\[1\])) TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable

This error occurs when you try to access an index of an integer, which is not allowed in Python.

From the error message, it seems like you are trying to access the first and second elements of an integer object. You can only access elements of a list, tuple, or other subscriptable objects.

To resolve this error, you need to check where in your code you are trying to access an index of an integer object and modify it accordingly.

> def getFloorAndCeil(arr, n, x): floor, ceil = -1, -1 low, high = 0, n-1 while low<=high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 if arr\[mid\] == x: return arr\[mid\] elif arr\[mid\] < x: floor = arr\[mid\] low = mid + 1 else: ceil = arr\[mid\] high = mid - 1 return \[floor, ceil\] # code here

This code is a binary search implementation to find the floor and ceiling of an element in a sorted array.

Here is how the code works:

*   Initialize the floor and ceiling values to -1.
*   Set the low and high pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively.
*   While the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer:
    *   Calculate the mid pointer using the formula: `mid = low + (high - low)//2`.
    *   If the value at the mid pointer is equal to the target value, return the value as it is the ceiling and floor of itself.
    *   If the value at the mid pointer is less than the target value, update the floor to the value at the mid pointer and move the low pointer to mid+1.
    *   If the value at the mid pointer is greater than the target value, update the ceiling to the value at the mid pointer and move the high pointer to mid-1.
*   Return the floor and ceiling values as a list.

Note: If the target value is less than the first element of the array, the floor value will be -1. If the target value is greater than the last element of the array, the ceiling value will be -1.

However, there is a minor issue in the code where the function is returning only the floor or ceiling value if it is found. To return both the floor and ceiling values, you should change the return statement to `return [floor, ceil]`.

> next alphabetical element in sorted characters

Here's a possible solution:

sql

```sql
def nextAlpha(characters, target):
    left, right = 0, len(characters) - 1
    result = None
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if characters[mid] > target:
            result = characters[mid]
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return result
```

This function takes a sorted list of characters `characters` and a target character `target`, and returns the next alphabetical element after `target` in the list. It uses binary search to find the smallest element greater than `target` in the list.

Here's an example usage:

python

```python
>>> nextAlpha(['a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g'], 'd')
'f'
```

> find the position of an element in infinite sorted array

In an infinite sorted array, it is not possible to use the length of the array for binary search as the array is infinite. Instead, we need to find a range of indices within which our target element could lie and then perform binary search within that range.

Here's one approach to solve this problem:

sql

```sql
def searchInInfiniteArray(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, 1
    # find the right boundary for binary search
    while arr[right] < target:
        left = right
        right *= 2
    
    # perform binary search within the found range
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    # if target is not found, return -1
    return -1
```

In this code, we start with an initial range of indices (`left=0` and `right=1`) and we keep doubling the right index until we find a range within which the target element could lie. Then, we perform binary search within that range to find the index of the target element.

Here's an example usage:

makefile

```makefile
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31]
target = 11
print(searchInInfiniteArray(arr, target))  # Output: 5
```

Note that the complexity of this approach is `O(logn)` where `n` is the position of the target element, as we only perform binary search within a small range of indices.

> index of first 1 in a binary sorted infinite array

To find the index of the first 1 in an infinitely sized sorted binary array, we need to first find the bounds of the array. Since the array is infinitely sized, we can't use the length of the array to find the bounds. Instead, we can use a two-pointer approach where we start with a low index at 0 and a high index at 1. We can then double the high index until we find an element greater than 1, and we can use these bounds to perform a binary search to find the first occurrence of 1.

Here's the code:

vbnet

```vbnet
def get_first_one(arr):
    low, high = 0, 1
    while arr[high] == 0:
        low = high
        high = high * 2
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == 1 and (mid == 0 or arr[mid-1] == 0):
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] == 1:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return -1  # Element not found
```

In this code, `arr` represents the infinitely sized sorted binary array, which is assumed to be a list of 0s and 1s. We start

> minimum difference element in a sorted array

To find the minimum difference element in a sorted array, we can use the binary search approach. The basic idea is to find the mid element and compare it with the key. Based on the comparison, we can move the search to the left or right of the mid element. We keep track of the minimum difference and the element that corresponds to it. We repeat this process until we reach a sub-array of size 2.

Here's the Python code to implement this:

python

```python
def minDiffElement(arr, key):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    min_diff = float('inf')
    result = -1

    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        diff = abs(arr[mid] - key)

        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            result = arr[mid]

        if arr[mid] == key:
            return arr[mid]
        elif arr[mid] < key:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return result
```

In this code, we initialize `low` and `high` to the first and last index of the array, respectively. We also initialize `min_diff` to a very large number and `result` to -1. We use `low` and `high` to define the sub-array we're currently searching in.

In the while loop, we find the mid element and calculate its difference with the `key`. If this difference is less than the current minimum difference (`min_diff`), we update `min_diff` and `result`.

Next, we check if the mid element is equal to the `key`. If it is, we return it. If it's less than the `key`, we search in the right half of the array by updating `low = mid + 1`. If it's greater than the `key`, we search in the left half of the array by updating `high = mid - 1`.

Finally, if we've searched the entire array and not found the `key`, we return the `result` which corresponds to the element with the minimum difference with the `key`.

> peak element

A peak element in an array is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array nums, where nums\[i\] ≠ nums\[i+1\], find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

For example, in the array \[1, 2, 3, 1\], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Here's the Python code to find a peak element in an array:

vbnet

```vbnet
def findPeakElement(nums):
    low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
                
    return low
```

The code starts with initializing `low` and `high` pointers. Then, it enters the while loop until `low` is less than `high`. Inside the while loop, it calculates the `mid` index and checks if `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[mid + 1]` or not. If it's greater, then the peak element must be in the left half of the array, so it sets `high` to `mid`. If not, then the peak element must be in the right half of the array, so it sets `low` to `mid + 1`. Finally, when `low` becomes equal to `high`, we have found the peak element, and we return the `low` index as the result.

This algorithm works in O(log n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, where n is the size of the input array.

> find maximum element in bitonic array

To find the maximum element in a bitonic array, we can use binary search. Here's the general idea:

1.  Find the index of the maximum element in the array using binary search.
2.  The index of the maximum element divides the array into two subarrays, both of which are sorted in descending order.
3.  Use binary search again to find the maximum element in each subarray, and return the larger of the two.

Here's the code to implement this:

python

```python
def find_max(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    low, high = 0, n-1
    
    # Find the index of the maximum element
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        if mid == 0:
            # First element is the maximum
            return arr[mid]
        elif mid == n-1:
            # Last element is the maximum
            return arr[mid]
        elif arr[mid] > arr[mid-1] and arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]:
            # Mid element is the maximum
            return arr[mid]
        elif arr[mid] > arr[mid-1]:
            # Maximum is in the right subarray
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            # Maximum is in the left subarray
            high = mid - 1
    
    # This line will never be reached, but we need to return something
    return -1

# Test the function
arr = [1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]
print(find_max(arr))  # Output: 12
```

> search an element in bitonic array

To search an element in a bitonic array, we can first find the peak element of the array using binary search. After finding the peak element, we can perform binary search on both the increasing and decreasing parts of the array.

Here is the code for searching an element in a bitonic array:

vbnet

```vbnet
def binary_search(arr, low, high, key, is_increasing):
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == key:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < key:
            if is_increasing:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        else:
            if is_increasing:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
    return -1

def search_bitonic_array(arr, key):
    n = len(arr)
    peak = find_peak(arr, 0, n-1)
    if arr[peak] == key:
        return peak
    else:
        idx = binary_search(arr, 0, peak-1, key, True)
        if idx != -1:
            return idx
        else:
            return binary_search(arr, peak+1, n-1, key, False)
```

Here, the `binary_search` function takes an array, the lower and upper indices of the subarray, the search key, and a boolean flag `is_increasing` which is `True` if the subarray is increasing, and `False` if the subarray is decreasing. It performs binary search on the subarray and returns the index of the key if found, or `-1` if not found.

The `search_bitonic_array` function first finds the peak element of the array using the `find_peak` function (which we saw earlier), and then performs binary search on the increasing and decreasing parts of the array separately using the `binary_search` function. If the key is found in either of the parts, its index is returned. Otherwise, `-1` is returned.

Note that the `search_bitonic_array` function assumes that the array is a valid bitonic array, i.e., it is first increasing and then decreasing. If the array is not bitonic, the function may not return the correct result.

> search in row wise and column wise sorted array

To search an element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted array, we can use a binary search approach. We will start from the top-right corner or bottom-left corner of the array and compare the target element with the current element. Based on the comparison, we will move left or down or right or up in the array.

Here is the general approach to solve this problem:

1.  Start from the top-right corner or bottom-left corner of the array.
2.  Compare the target element with the current element.
3.  If the target element is equal to the current element, return the position of the element.
4.  If the target element is smaller than the current element, move left.
5.  If the target element is greater than the current element, move down.
6.  If we reach the end of the row or column, return -1 (element not found).

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:

python

```python
def search_in_sorted_matrix(matrix, target):
    # Get the number of rows and columns in the matrix
    rows = len(matrix)
    cols = len(matrix[0])
    
    # Start from the top-right corner of the matrix
    row = 0
    col = cols - 1
    
    # Keep moving left, down, or up in the matrix based on the comparison with the target
    while row < rows and col >= 0:
        if matrix[row][col] == target:
            return (row, col)
        elif matrix[row][col] < target:
            row += 1
        else:
            col -= 1
    
    # Element not found
    return -1
```

Here, `matrix` is the input matrix, and `target` is the element we want to search. The function returns the position of the element if it is found, or -1 otherwise.

Note that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(m + n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we are moving left or down or up in the matrix at most m + n times.

> allocate minimum number of pages

Problem:

You are given N number of books. Every ith book has Ai number of pages. You have to allocate contagious books to M number of students. There can be many ways or permutations to do so. In each permutation, one of the M students will be allocated the maximum number of pages. Out of all these permutations, the task is to find that particular permutation in which the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimum of those in all the other permutations and print this minimum value.

Example:

Input: N = 4 A = \[12,34,67,90\] M = 2

Output: 113

Explanation: Here, we can divide the books into 2 parts:

1.  \[12, 34, 67\] and \[90\]
2.  \[12\], \[34, 67\], \[90\] In the first case, maximum number of pages assigned to a student is 191. In the second case, maximum number of pages assigned to a student is 171. So, the output will be 113, which is the minimum of 191 and 171.

Solution:

We can use binary search to find the minimum number of pages allocated to the students. The minimum value can be between the maximum value of the array and the sum of all the elements of the array.

Let mid be the average of the maximum value and the sum of all the elements of the array. We will check if this value is the minimum number of pages allocated to the students. If it is, then we will check for a smaller value in the left half of the range, otherwise, we will check for a larger value in the right half of the range.

For each mid value, we will check if it is possible to allocate the books to the students in such a way that the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is equal to mid.

We will start with the first book and keep adding the pages of the books to the current student until the sum of the pages is greater than mid. In this case, we will start a new student and continue the process until all the books are allocated to the students.

If the number of students required to allocate the books is less than or equal to M, then the current mid value is possible. Otherwise, the mid value is not possible and we need to search for a larger value.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

sql

```sql
def isPossible(A, n, m, curr_min):
    studentsRequired = 1
    curr_sum = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if A[i] > curr_min:
            return False

        if curr_sum + A[i] > curr_min:
            studentsRequired += 1
            curr_sum = A[i]

            if studentsRequired > m:
                return False
        else:
            curr_sum += A[i]

    return True

def allocatePages(A, n, m):
    if n < m:
        return -1

    sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        sum += A[i]

    start = 0
    end = sum
    result = 10**9

    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end)//2

        if isPossible(A, n, m, mid):
            result = min(result, mid)
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1

    return result
```
