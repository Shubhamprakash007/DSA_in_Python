Binary search is a search algorithm that is used to find a particular value in a sorted list or array. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, and comparing the value you are searching for to the middle element of the interval. If the value is less than the middle element, then the search continues on the lower half of the interval; if it is greater than the middle element, then the search continues on the upper half of the interval. This process is repeated until the value is found, or until the search interval is empty.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the binary search algorithm:

1.  Given a sorted list or array of values, set the lower and upper bounds of the search interval to the first and last indices of the list, respectively.
2.  Calculate the middle index of the search interval by taking the average of the lower and upper bounds (i.e., middle\_index = (lower\_bound + upper\_bound) / 2).
3.  Compare the value you are searching for to the middle element of the search interval.
4.  If the value is equal to the middle element, then you have found the value and can return its index.
5.  If the value is less than the middle element, then set the upper bound of the search interval to the index immediately below the middle index, and repeat steps 2-4 with the new search interval.
6.  If the value is greater than the middle element, then set the lower bound of the search interval to the index immediately above the middle index, and repeat steps 2-4 with the new search interval.
7.  If the search interval is empty (i.e., the lower bound is greater than the upper bound), then the value was not found in the list.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

> what are all the different types of binary search problems

There are several different types of binary search problems that you may encounter. Here are a few examples:

1.  Basic binary search: This is the simplest form of binary search, where you are given a sorted list of values and asked to find a specific value in the list.
    
2.  Search for a range: In this type of problem, you are given a sorted list of values and asked to find the first and last indices of a specific value in the list. This can be done using binary search to find the first occurrence of the value, and then again to find the last occurrence.
    
3.  Rotated sorted array: In a rotated sorted array, the elements of a sorted array are rotated by some unknown amount. In this type of problem, you are given a rotated sorted array and asked to find a specific value in the array. This can be done using a modified version of binary search that takes into account the rotation.
    
4.  Minimum/maximum element: In this type of problem, you are given a sorted array that has been rotated by an unknown amount, and asked to find the minimum or maximum element in the array. This can be done using a modified version of binary search that takes into account the rotation.
    
5.  Median of two sorted arrays: In this type of problem, you are given two sorted arrays of equal length and asked to find the median of the two arrays. This can be done using a modified version of binary search that compares the medians of the two arrays and recursively divides the arrays until the median is found.
    
6.  Allocate minimum number of pages: In this type of problem, you are given a list of books with the number of pages in each book, and you are asked to allocate the books to a given number of students in such a way that the maximum number of pages allocated to any student is minimized. This can be solved using a modified version of binary search that tries different allocation strategies and finds the minimum value that satisfies the allocation constraints.
    

These are just a few examples of the different types of binary search problems you may encounter. The key to solving binary search problems is to identify the pattern or property of the input that allows you to use binary search, and then carefully apply the algorithm to the problem.

> give general python template for each category with slight modification will able to solve all problems of that category

Sure, here are some general Python templates for each category of binary search problems:

1.  Basic binary search:

vbnet

```vbnet
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return -1  # target not found
```

2.  Search for a range:

python

```python
def search_range(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    # find the first occurrence of target
    first = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            first = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    if first == -1:
        return [-1, -1]  # target not found
    
    # find the last occurrence of target
    low, high = first, len(arr) - 1
    last = first
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            last = mid
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return [first, last]
```

3.  Rotated sorted array:

vbnet

```vbnet
def search_rotated_sorted_array(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] >= arr[low]:
            if target >= arr[low] and target < arr[mid]:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        else:
            if target <= arr[high] and target > arr[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
                
    return -1  # target not found
```

4.  Minimum/maximum element:

vbnet

```vbnet
def find_minimum_element(arr):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < arr[high]:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
            
    return arr[low]
```

vbnet

```vbnet
def find_maximum_element(arr):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > arr[low]:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return arr[low]
```

5.  Median of two sorted arrays:

python

```python
def find_median_sorted_arrays(nums1, nums2):
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1  # make sure nums1 is the shorter array
    
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    imin, imax = 0, m
    
    while imin <= imax:
        i = (imin + imax) // 2
        j =
```

> continue

less

    ```less
half_len = (m + n + 1) // 2 - i
    
    if i < m and nums2[half_len - 1] > nums1[i]:
        imin = i + 1
    elif i > 0 and nums1[i - 1] > nums2[half_len]:
        imax = i - 1
    else:
        if i == 0:
            max_left = nums2[half_len - 1]
        elif half_len == 0:
            max_left = nums1[i - 1]
        else:
            max_left = max(nums1[i - 1], nums2[half_len - 1])
            
        if (m + n) % 2 == 1:
            return max_left
        
        if i == m:
            min_right = nums2[half_len]
        elif half_len == n:
            min_right = nums1[i]
        else:
            min_right = min(nums1[i], nums2[half_len])
            
        return (max_left + min_right) / 2.0
```

I hope these templates help you to solve binary search problems in Python!
```

> also give template of 6th category

Sure, here is a general Python template for the 6th category of binary search problems, which involves using binary search to solve a problem that doesn't directly involve searching for a value in an array:

6.  Miscellaneous binary search problems:

python

```python
def binary_search_misc():
    # initialize low and high pointers
    low, high = 0, 1000
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # perform some check or computation
        result = check(mid)
        
        # update low and high pointers based on result
        if result == 0:
            return mid  # found the solution
        elif result < 0:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
            
    return -1  # solution not found
```

In this template, the `check()` function is where the actual computation or problem-solving happens, and it returns a value that tells us whether we should move the low or high pointer. The `binary_search_misc()` function takes care of initializing the pointers and calling `check()` repeatedly until the solution is found or it determines that there is no solution. You would need to modify this template for each specific problem by defining the `check()` function appropriately.

> also give template for Allocate minimum number of pages

Sure, here's a Python template for the "Allocate minimum number of pages" problem:

python

```python
def allocate_minimum_pages(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < k:
        return -1
    
    # initialize low and high pointers
    low, high = max(arr), sum(arr)
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # check if it's possible to divide array into k subarrays with max sum <= mid
        num_partitions = count_partitions(arr, mid)
        
        # update low and high pointers based on result
        if num_partitions <= k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
            
    return low

def count_partitions(arr, max_sum):
    num_partitions = 1
    current_sum = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x > max_sum:
            return float('inf')
        if current_sum + x <= max_sum:
            current_sum += x
        else:
            num_partitions += 1
            current_sum = x
    return num_partitions
```

In this template, the `allocate_minimum_pages()` function takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` and returns the minimum possible maximum sum of any partition of `arr` with exactly `k` partitions. The function first initializes the low and high pointers based on the minimum and maximum possible values of the maximum sum, respectively. It then uses binary search to narrow down the possible range of values for the maximum sum.

The `count_partitions()` function is used within the binary search loop to determine whether it's possible to divide the array `arr` into `k` partitions with maximum sum less than or equal to `mid`. It returns the number of partitions needed to do so. If it's not possible to divide the array into `k` partitions with maximum sum less than or equal to `mid`, it returns infinity.

You can modify this template to solve variations of the problem that involve different constraints or requirements.

Again, these are just some examples, and there are many other binary search problems out there that fall into these categories or variations of them.

> give template for Classical binary search problems such that with slight modification will able to solve all problems of this category

Sure, here's a Python template for the Classical binary search problems:

sql

```sql
def binary_search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return -1
```

In this template, the `binary_search()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target` and returns the index of the target value in the array, or -1 if it's not found. The function initializes the left and right pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively, and uses binary search to narrow down the possible range of indices that could contain the target value.

You can modify this template to solve variations of the Classical binary search problem that involve different constraints or requirements. For example, if the array is rotated and sorted, you can modify the `binary_search()` function to find the minimum element in the array:

sql

```sql
def find_min(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
            
    return nums[left]
```

In this modified template, the `find_min()` function takes a rotated and sorted array `nums` and returns the minimum element in the array. The function initializes the left and right pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively, and uses binary search to narrow down the possible range of indices that could contain the minimum element.

You can similarly modify this template to solve other variations of the Classical binary search problem.

> give general template for Binary search on answer problem

Sure, here's a Python template for the Binary search on answer problems:

sql

```sql
def binary_search_on_answer(nums, left, right):
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if is_valid(nums, mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return left
```

In this template, the `binary_search_on_answer()` function takes an array `nums`, a left pointer `left`, and a right pointer `right`, and returns the answer to the problem using binary search. The `is_valid()` function is a helper function that checks whether a given answer is valid, and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

To use this template to solve a Binary search on answer problem, you would need to modify the `is_valid()` function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Split Array Largest Sum" problem, the `is_valid()` function would check whether it is possible to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum less than or equal to the given mid value:

python

```python
def is_valid(nums, mid, m):
    count = 1
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
        if total > mid:
            count += 1
            total = num
            if count > m:
                return False
    
    return True
```

In this modified template, the `is_valid()` function takes an array `nums`, a mid value `mid`, and an integer `m`, and returns `True` if it is possible to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum less than or equal to `mid` and the total number of subarrays is less than or equal to `m`. The function uses a count variable to keep track of the number of subarrays, and a total variable to keep track of the sum of elements in each subarray.

You can modify this template and the `is_valid()` function to solve other variations of the Binary search on answer problem.

> give general template for Floor and ceiling values problems

Sure, here's a Python template for the Floor and Ceiling values problems:

python

```python
def floor_ceiling(nums, target):
    # Find the index of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    floor_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] <= target:
            floor_idx = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    # Find the index of the smallest element larger than or equal to the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    ceiling_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            ceiling_idx = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return (floor_idx, ceiling_idx)
```

In this template, the `floor_ceiling()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns a tuple containing the indices of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target (the floor value) and the smallest element larger than or equal to the target (the ceiling value).

To use this template to solve a specific Floor and Ceiling values problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Find K Closest Elements" problem, you would need to modify the function to return the K closest elements to the target value:

python

```python
def find_k_closest(nums, target, k):
    # Find the index of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    floor_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] <= target:
            floor_idx = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    # Find the index of the smallest element larger than the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    ceiling_idx = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            ceiling_idx = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # Use the two indices to find the K closest elements to the target
    result = []
    while len(result) < k:
        if floor_idx < 0:
            result.append(nums[ceiling_idx])
            ceiling_idx += 1
        elif ceiling_idx >= len(nums):
            result.append(nums[floor_idx])
            floor_idx -= 1
        elif abs(nums[floor_idx] - target) <= abs(nums[ceiling_idx] - target):
            result.append(nums[floor_idx])
            floor_idx -= 1
        else:
            result.append(nums[ceiling_idx])
            ceiling_idx += 1
    
    result.sort()
    return result
```

In this modified template, the `find_k_closest()` function takes an array `nums`, a target value `target`, and an integer `k`, and returns an array containing the `k` closest elements to the target value. The function uses the `floor_ceiling()` function to find the indices of the largest element smaller than or equal to the target and the smallest element larger than the target, and then uses a while loop to iterate through the two

> give general template for First occurrence and last occurrence problems

2 / 2

Sure, here's a Python template for the First occurrence and Last occurrence problems:

sql

```sql
def first_last_occurrence(nums, target):
    # Find the first occurrence of the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    first_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            if nums[mid] == target:
                first_occurrence = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # Find the last occurrence of the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    last_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] <= target:
            if nums[mid] == target:
                last_occurrence = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return (first_occurrence, last_occurrence)
```

In this template, the `first_last_occurrence()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns a tuple containing the index of the first occurrence of the target and the index of the last occurrence of the target.

To use this template to solve a specific First occurrence or Last occurrence problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Search Insert Position" problem, you would need to modify the function to return the index where the target should be inserted if it is not present in the array:

sql

```sql
def search_insert(nums, target):
    # Find the first occurrence of the target
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    first_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            if nums[mid] == target:
                first_occurrence = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # If the target is found, return its index
    if first_occurrence != -1:
        return first_occurrence
    
    # If the target is not found, return the index where it should be inserted
    return left
```

In this modified template, the `search_insert()` function takes an array `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns the index where the target should be inserted if it is not present in the array. The function uses the `first_last_occurrence()` function to find the index of the first occurrence of the target, and then returns this index if it is found. If the target is not found, the function returns the index where the target should be inserted, which is the value of `left` after the binary search loop.

> give general template for Searching in 2D matrix problems

Sure, here's a Python template for Searching in 2D matrix problems:

sql

```sql
def search_matrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    left, right = 0, m*n-1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        i, j = mid // n, mid % n
        
        if matrix[i][j] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[i][j] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return False
```

In this template, the `search_matrix()` function takes a 2D matrix `matrix` and a target value `target`, and returns `True` if the target value is present in the matrix, and `False` otherwise.

The template works by treating the 2D matrix as a 1D array, and performing a binary search on the 1D array. To do this, we use two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the start and end of the 1D array. We initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `m*n-1`, where `m` is the number of rows in the matrix and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.

In each iteration of the binary search loop, we compute the middle index `mid` of the 1D array, and convert it to a 2D index `(i, j)` using integer division and modulo operations. We then compare the value at the `(i, j)` index of the matrix to the target value, and update the pointers `left` and `right` accordingly.

If the target value is found in the matrix, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the binary search loop terminates and the target value is not found in the matrix, the function returns `False`.

To use this template to solve a specific Searching in 2D matrix problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Search a 2D Matrix II" problem, you would need to modify the function to account for the fact that the matrix is sorted both horizontally and vertically:

python

```python
def search_matrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    i, j = 0, n-1
    
    while i < m and j >= 0:
        if matrix[i][j] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[i][j] < target:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
            
    return False
```

In this modified template, the `search_matrix()` function takes a 2D matrix `matrix` and a target value `target`, and returns `True` if the target value is present in the matrix, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a two-pointer approach, starting at the top-right corner of the matrix and moving left or down depending on whether the current value is greater or less than the target value. This approach takes advantage of the fact that the matrix is sorted both horizontally and vertically, and allows us to eliminate entire rows or columns of the matrix with each comparison. If the target value is found in the matrix, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the two-pointer loop terminates and the target value is not found in the matrix, the function returns `False`.

> give general template for misllenious binary search problems

Sure, here's a Python template for miscellaneous binary search problems:

sql

```sql
def binary_search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            # Target found, return mid or do some processing
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            # Target is to the right of mid, search right half
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # Target is to the left of mid, search left half
            right = mid - 1
            
    # Target not found
    return -1
```

In this template, the `binary_search()` function takes a sorted list of numbers `nums` and a target value `target`, and returns the index of the target value in the list if it is present, or `-1` if it is not.

The template works by initializing two pointers `left` and `right` to the start and end of the list, respectively. In each iteration of the binary search loop, we compute the middle index `mid` of the list using integer division, and compare the value at the `mid` index to the target value. If the value at the `mid` index is equal to the target value, we have found the target and return the `mid` index (or do some other processing). Otherwise, we update the pointers `left` and `right` based on whether the target value is to the left or right of the `mid` index, and continue the binary search.

To use this template to solve a specific miscellaneous binary search problem, you would need to modify the function to reflect the specific problem requirements. For example, if you were trying to solve the "Find Peak Element" problem, which asks you to find any peak element in an unsorted array (where a peak element is defined as an element that is greater than its neighbors), you could modify the function as follows:

sql

```sql
def find_peak_element(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]:
            # Peak is to the left of mid, search left half
            right = mid
        else:
            # Peak is to the right of mid, search right half
            left = mid + 1
            
    # left pointer now points to a peak element
    return left
```

In this modified template, the `find_peak_element()` function takes an unsorted list of numbers `nums` and returns the index of any peak element in the list. The function uses a modified binary search approach where we compare the value at the `mid` index to its neighbor to the right. If the value at the `mid` index is greater than its neighbor to the right, we know that a peak element must exist to the left of `mid`, so we search the left half of the list. Otherwise, the peak element must exist to the right of `mid`, so we search the right half of the list. We continue this process until we have found a peak element, which will be located at the `left` pointer.
